  "body": " Rational Exponents and Radicals   Recall that previously, powers and exponents are a concise notation to write repeated multiplication. For example, means multiply 3, 4 times, or .  We can extend the definition of exponents to allow for exponents which are fractions (i.e. rational numbers). For example, expressions like,   At first, the previous definition of exponents as how many times you're multiplying doesn't seem to make sense. After all, for example, for , what does it mean to multiply 4 by itself 3\/2 times?   Suppose that we extend exponents to be allowed to be any rational number. Then, we want the laws of exponents to still work. In particular, the two fundamental laws,   Then, consider . By properties of exponents, we have,   This shows that multiplied by itself is equal to 3. In other words, . On the other hand, we know that multiplied by itself is equal to 3, or,   This means that and must be the same number, and so .   In general, for any number , if we multiply by itself, we get,   This means that , and so is the square root of .    Rational Exponents     In other words,   Technically, there are two numbers whose square is , which are and . We define to be the positive square root of .  In a similar way, for an exponent of , we have,   Therefore, , and so is the cube root of .   In general, this works for any exponent of the form .     Next, we want to define a rational exponent when the numerator is a number other than 1, like , or .   Consider . Recognize that is just , so,   And so . On the other hand,   And so . Putting both of them together, we get that all of these are equal,   and all of them are equal to 4.   In general,     This means that when raising a number to a fraction power ,    Take the th root and then raise to the th power.    Or: Raise it to the the th power and then take the th root.    In short,    Numerator exponent.    Denominator root index.    Some notes:    Decimal exponents can be thought of as fraction exponents. For example, .    Note that when evaluating expressions with rational exponents with a calculator, be sure to put parentheses around the fraction. Most calculators will evaluate as , because with order of operations, exponentiation is higher than division.    Note that this always works, except if is even and is negative, because we can't take the square root (or any even root) of a negative number.    We can also define negative rational exponents, in the same way as negative integer exponents.       Summary of Rational Exponents and Exponent Laws  In summary,   All of the laws of exponents also apply to rational exponents.    Exponent laws .      Converting Between Rational Exponents and Radicals    Write each expression in exponent form.                                              Write each expression in radical form.                     Write each expression in radical form in 2 ways.                Evaluating Rational Exponents Exact Values Examples    Evaluate each power, without using a calculator.

  "title": "Factoring Quadratic Trinomials",
  "body": " Factoring Quadratic Trinomials    Factoring quadratic trinomials is arguably the single most used skill in high-school mathematics, being used in uncountably many high-school (and college) math problems. In this way, it is a very important foundational skill to master. However, unfortunately, it is among the least important and least useful topics in the real world .  The goal is to factor any expression of the form , where are any integers.    First, we'll start with a simpler case, when .    Then, we'll consider the more difficult case, when .      Factoring (Sum and Product Method)  We want to take an expression like , and rewrite it as . The question is: how to choose the two numbers to put in the brackets? Observe the pattern for how expansions work. For example, consider the expansion of ,   Here are some other expansions,   Observe how expanding the left side leads to the right side.    On the right side, there are always 3 terms: , an term, and a constant number term.    Further, to get the coefficient of the middle term, you add the two numbers in the brackets.    To get the last constant term, you multiply those two numbers.    In other words,   In general, if we multiply two factors together, say and , we get,     The first term is always .    The coefficient of the middle term is the sum of and .    The last term is the product of and .    In summary,   This leads to a general rule for factoring an expression of the form .    Factoring with Positive Terms  Factor . We want two numbers that multiply to 12 and add to 7. There are many pairs of numbers that add to 7, so we'll start with numbers that multiply to 12. Our choices are:   Notice that if we choose 3 and 4, they also add to 7. So this is the correct combination. Then,     Factoring with Negative Middle Term  Factor . We want two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to . Here are the possible pairs of factors:   At first, it seems none of these add to . However, we can also have both of our numbers be negative, because two negative numbers also multiply to a positive. For example,   Then, and is the correct combination. Then,     Rearranging to Standard Form  Consider . This is still a quadratic trinomial. At first glance, it's a bit different than the previous examples, because it's not written in the usual order for a quadratic. The highest power term, , is at the end instead of the beginning. When factoring, you should always arrange the terms in the same order: first, next, and constant last. This is called descending power order (the exponent on from largest to smallest), and is often called standard form .   Now, it looks like a regular quadratic. We need two numbers that multiply to 12 and add to . After some guessing, the correct combination is and . Therefore,    In summary,    (If necessary) Arrange the trinomial in descending power order.    Find two numbers that multiply to , and check if they add to .    If they do, then write it as .

Some additional helpful observations,    When the constant term is positive, then the factors of must be either both positive or both negative. If the middle term is positive, then both must be positive. If the middle term is negative, then both must be negative.   E.g. (last term is positive, middle term is positive, so both factors are positive)    E.g. (last term is positive, middle term is negative, so both factors are negative)       When the constant term is negative, then the factors of must have opposite signs (one positive, one negative). The sign of the larger number will be the sign of the coefficient of the middle term.   E.g. (last term is negative, so signs are opposite, and middle term is negative, so and 3 is negative)    E.g. (last term is negative, so signs are opposite, and middle term is positive, so and the 5 is positive)        Unfactorable Trinomial   Trinomial that cannot be factored. . In fact, not all trinomials can be factored. Consider . To factor this, we would need two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to 4. The options are: or . Neither of them work. This means that is not factorable.   Polynomials which cannot be factored are called prime , or irreducible . Prime in the same way as a prime number like 7 cannot be factored into smaller pieces, and irreducible similarly means not reducible . For now, problems will almost always have only factorable polynomials.

Factoring Trinomials with Common Factors  Sometimes the trinomial is set up so that (the number in front of is not 1), however, there is a common factor that can be factored out, reducing the expression to one which can be factored using the previous method.   Factoring with GCF First   Factor each quadratic expression completely.     .    .      .    .      .    .      .    .      .    .      .    .      .    .      .    .       Factoring Polynomials of the form ,  There are many methods for factoring these kinds of polynomials. Different teachers will differ in which method they use. All of them end up with the same result, but some are more efficient than others. I personally believe the cross method is the most efficient and easiest method to use.    The Cross Method   First Cross Method Example  Consider,   To do the cross method,    Draw a crisscross or X shape underneath.    Find two things that multiply to the first term, and two things that multiply to the last term.    Multiply each of the diagonals and add them up.    The combination is correct if the diagonals add up to the middle term.    For example,      On the left side, , and on the right, . However, the diagonals add up to , which isn't the middle term. Instead, switch the 3 and the 1,      We now get , which is the middle term. After you've found the correct combination, the two factors can be read horizontally in each row,        Cross Method with Negatives  Consider,   Using the cross method, one possible combination is,      On the left side, , and on the right, . However, the diagonals add up to , which isn't the middle term, so this isn't correct. Instead, switch the 2 and the ,      Now the diagonals add to , which is not quite , but it's close. To fix it, just change the negative sign on the right to be on the 2 instead of the 1,      Now the diagonals add up to , which matches the middle term. Reading across gives the factors:        Cross Method with Trial and Error  Consider,   For the left side, we have 6, which means we could choose 6 and 1, or 3 and 2. We don't know ahead of time which will be correct, so let's choose 6 and 1, and we can change it later.      The diagonals add up to , which is too large. Let's switch the 2 and 5,      Now the diagonals are , which is close but still not 19. Try different factor pairs of 10: and .      Now the diagonals are , still not enough. Switching gives,      Now we get , too large. We've tried all of the possible combinations on the right side, so this means that the left side is wrong. Let’s try and instead.      Now the diagonals add to , perfect! Reading across gives,       The cross method requires some guessing and checking (or trial and error), especially at first. However, with some practice and gain experience, you'll become more experienced at making educated guesses for the combinations that are more likely to work, so you won't have to naively go through every single combination. Also, sometimes you get lucky and find the correct combination right away.    Using the cross method when . The cross method can also be used in the previous simpler case, when . For example, for,   We could think of factors of that add up to , which are and 4, to get,   However, we can also use the cross method. The first term is , so we can write and on the left side, and the last term is , so we can try and on the right side. Then, we draw a crisscross or X shape, multiply the diagonals, and add them up. The combination is correct if the diagonals add up to the middle term.       This gives the same answer as before.    Factoring out a Negative   Factor out the negative sign first . Consider . In this case, which is negative, unlike the previous examples. You could continue just like before, by finding two things that multiply to and 3. For example,      This combination doesn't work.  However, it turns out that the negative sign on the left side makes things more complicated, because you have to worry about where to put the negative sign on the left side (in addition to the right side being either 3 and 1 or and ). There are a lot of negative signs, and it can get confusing.  Instead, it's better to first factor out the negative sign in the front. To do this, factor out from all terms, which basically flips the sign of all the terms,   Then, factor the expression inside the brackets as before. Now, you don't need to worry about the sign on the left column, and the only sign choice for the , where one of the numbers must be negative.        In general, if the value is negative, factor out from all terms first, and then factor the remaining polynomial.   Factoring out GCF Before Cross Method   Factor out the GCF before using the cross method . Consider,   Here, we can still use the cross method. However, the numbers are kinda large, especially 30, which has many possibilities for its factors. After some trial and error, the correct combination is,      However, notice that also contains a common factor of 2, so we should factor it out also.   Instead, it is easier to first factor out the common factor of 2,   Then, factoring the remaining only uses the sum and product method, and has smaller numbers to work with,    In general, you should first factor out the GCF (greatest common factor), if there is one, before using the cross method. This makes the numbers you have to work with smaller, making it easier to find the factors.

If ( ), find two numbers that multiply to and add to .    If ( ), use the cross method.       To check your answer, you can expand (FOIL) and check if you get back the original expression.     "

  "body": " Polynomial Functions Intro   Previously, the two main types of functions we considered were:    Linear functions, and,   Quadratic functions      Type of function  Example  General Form    Linear function (line)      Quadratic function (parabola)       It turns out that we can also consider functions that are made up of higher powers of , like , and so on. In general, we call this a polynomial function. So, linear and quadratic functions are specific types of polynomial functions.   Exploring Polynomial Graphs  Let's explore polynomial functions. We'll start with the most basic types, which are just a single power of . We can graph polynomial functions using Desmos.    Exploration of power functions . Consider the graphs of , , , , , . Observe the pattern in the shapes.  Even integer powers have a U-shape whereas the odd integer powers have an S-shape .    Power functions with negatives . Consider , , , , , . These are basically the previous graphs except upside down . In other words, a reflection over the -axis of the previous graphs.     functions with more terms . Consider adding terms with smaller exponents. Take a function that starts with , and add some terms like , , or a constant.       Observe that the first 3 all have the same S-shape, that starts in the bottom left and ends in the top right. The last 2 also share similar shapes, starting in the top left and ending in the bottom right. Observe that the negative sign in front basically reflects it upside down. The precise behavior of the function and how it goes up and down is much more complicated, however, and can't be determined just by looking at the equation.     functions with more terms . Let's do the same thing, but with an function.      Again, observe that they all have the same U-shape , and the ones with a negative in front are basically upside down.   In fact, you have seen this pattern before with parabolas (quadratic functions). Quadratic functions with various numbers . Recall that the number in front of (called the leading coefficient ) determines if it opens up or opens down . In particular, if it opens up, and if it opens down.   In summary,   The rough shape of a polynomial function is determined by the term with the highest power of .   In particular, it is based on:  The biggest exponent the polynomial has.  If the number in front is positive or negative.         Polynomial Functions  Basically, a polynomial function is made up of powers of , combined with numbers through multiplication, addition, and subtraction. Sometimes, we refer to them simply as polynomials.   Roughly, a polynomial function is a function made up of adding and subtracting powers of with whole number exponents.    The degree of a polynomial function is the exponent on its highest power of .  Intuitively, degree means size , the degree of a polynomial can be thought of as how big it is.      The term with the highest power of is called the leading term , and its coefficient is called the leading coefficient .  Intuitively, leading means most important or in front .       The domain of a polynomial is all real numbers, or (or, ). This is because it only uses the basic operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication of numbers, and these operations are always defined.  The graph of a polynomial function is both:    Smooth : it has no sharp corners.   Continuous : it has no breaks and can be drawn without lifting your pencil off the page.    Polynomial and Non-Polynomial Functions  Here are some functions which are polynomials, and some which are not.    is a polynomial, of degree 3, because all of the exponents are whole numbers.   is not a polynomial, because of the exponent of .   is not a polynomial, because it has the square root of .   is not a polynomial, because there is an in the denominator.   is a polynomial, intuitively because if you were to expand out all of the brackets, all of the powers of would be whole numbers.   Notice that all of the non-examples of polynomials either:   Don't have a domain which is all real numbers (they are undefined for some values of ), or,  Are not smooth (they have sharp corners) or not continuous (they have breaks).    Polynomials also have special names based on their degree.   Polynomials of degree 2 are called quadratic (which you've already learned before).  Polynomials of degree 3 are called cubic .  Degree 4 is quartic .  Degree 5 is quintic .  Degree 6 is sextic or hexic .   You can always just say degree 3 polynomial or degree 4 polynomial , but you should be aware of these terms. Typically, the higher the degree of the polynomial, the more complicated it is.    Turning Points of a Polynomial  A polynomial can have multiple points where it turns around , going from increasing to decreasing, or decreasing to increasing.   A linear function ( ) has 0 turning points (it never bends).  Quadratic ( ) has 1 turning point (the vertex).  Cubic ( ) has up to 2 turning points.  Quartic ( ) has up to 3 turning points.   It turns out that in general, a polynomial of degree can have at most turning points.    End Behavior of a Polynomial  As we've seen, the graph of a polynomial function can go either up or down on the left and right side, depending on its equation. This is called it's end behavior .   The end behavior of a function is its behavior as becomes large in either the positive or negative direction.   Graphically, end behavior is what the function does to the far right or far left side of the graph. The graph of a polynomial function may increase in some places and decrease in others, however it will eventually tend towards either going up or down .   Sometimes polynomial functions go right and up, sometimes they go right and down,  Sometimes they go left and up, and other times left and down.   The end behavior of a polynomial function is determined by the leading term. Intuitively, this is because when is large (either large positive, or large negative), the leading term dominates the other terms, in the sense that it's size is much bigger than the others. All other terms become insignificant in size.  In particular, the end behavior of a polynomial depends on both:   Its degree , being even or odd.  Its leading coefficient , being positive or negative.   It can be summarized in this table:    End behavior table     Some observations:   Even-degree polynomials have the same end behavior on each side.  Odd-degree polynomials have opposite end behavior.   Also,   For even-degree polynomials, the leading coefficient determines if it opens up or opens down (similar to a parabola).  For odd-degree polynomials, the sign of the leading coefficient determines the overall trend, if it overall has positive slope (like ) or negative slope (like ), (similar to a line).   There are a few ways to describe end behavior:   The simplest is just to draw that little sketch of how the arrows will go on the left side and the right side.   Another way is through the quadrants, which looks like this:  End behavior table      Remember that the quadrants are labelled starting from the top right, and going counterclockwise, like this:          y-Intercept of a Polynomial  Recall that the -intercept for linear and quadratic functions is simply the constant term,   This is because to find the -intercept, set , and solve for . Doing this makes all of the terms vanish, leaving only the constant term left. In general, the -intercept of a polynomial function is the constant term.   y-intercept Example  For , the -intercept is .     x-Intercepts (Zeros) of a Polynomial  For -intercepts, first note that the terms zero , root , and -intercept are all somewhat used interchangably. Zero and root are more truly synonyms, whereas -intercept typically refers to the point on the graph (where it touches the -axis).   A number is a zero or ( root ) of if . The following are equivalent:    is a zero of .   is a root of .   is an -intercept of the graph of .    Recall that to find -intercepts, you set , and solve for .   Finding x-intercepts  For , we get,   and we need to solve for . It is not obvious how to do this at first glance.   In general, the -intercept(s) of a polynomial function are the solutions to the equation .  We will explore various techniques to solve equations like this. Most of the examples will be simple, with numbers chosen very carefully so that the problem is solvable. In general, solving this equation by hand and exactly is very difficult, and sometimes actually impossible (and only possible approximately).   "

  "body": " Polynomial Zeros, Factored Form   Recall that a big part of analyzing quadratic functions was to be able to find their zeros, i.e. to solve quadratic equations. In a similar way, we want to find zeros of higher-degree polynomial functions.  However, this is not as easy. In fact, it is not even possible to do exactly in general for any given polynomial.  Recall that for quadratic equations, there are 3 main techniques:   Using technology (graphing).  Factoring.  Quadratic formula.   Unfortunately, there is no easy formula (similar to the quadratic formula) that can solve 3rd degree, 4th degree, or higher degree equations. This means that we will have to use factoring (by hand) or technology.    Zeros by Technology\/Graphing Calculator\/Desmos  The easiest way to find the zeros of a polynomial function is using technology. Graph the function using Desmos , and observe the -intercepts, which are the zeros.  However, you may not get the zeros in exact form, depending on if they are integers, fractions, or irrational numbers.    Solving Polynomial Equations in Factored Form  Recall that many quadratic equations were solved by factoring them and setting each factor equal to zero. If the quadratic in factored form, then finding its zeros is straightforward.   Solving a Factored Quadratic  For example,   We set each factor equal to zero:   So the solutions are and . Or, you might just read off the solutions from the equation itself.   You might recall that this is called the zero product property , which says that if the product of two numbers is 0, then one of the numbers must be equal to 0. In othre words, for 2 numbers and , if , then or . This is the fundamental property used to solve quadratic equations by factoring.  This idea generalizes to higher degree polynomials, with more than 2 terms.   Solving a Factored Cubic Polynomial  For example, consider this polynomial with 3 factors,   It is cubic, because it has 3 linear factors. If you were to expand it out, the highest power would be . To find the zeros, set :   Then each factor can be set to zero:   Solving gives:   Thus, the solutions are .    Solving a Factored Quartic Polynomial  Similarly, for this degree 4 (quartic) polynomial equation,   Setting each factor equal to zero gives:   Solving gives:     Factors Not in Standard Form  Sometimes the factors might not be written in the standard form. For example,   Setting each factor equal to zero:   Solving gives:   The solutions are .    Factors with Multiplicity  The exponents on the factors can also vary. For example,   However, it doesn't change the strategy. Set each factor to zero, giving,   And solve for ,   So the zeros are and .   In general, if you have a bunch of factors multiplied together that equals 0, then each of the factors can be 0. In this way, solving polynomial equations in this form is easy.   Zero product property  If the product of any number of factors is equal to zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero.   A polynomial written as a product of its factors is said to be in factored form .

Summary of Factoring Higher-Degree Polynomial Functions    (If necessary) Write the polynomial in descending power order.    Check for common factors. If there are any common factors, either a variable, number, or both. If so, factor out the greatest common factor (GCF).   e.g. .  e.g. .  If the leading coefficient is negative, factor out from all its terms.  Especially check if the numbers in the equation are big!     Find one factor, by testing potential zeros until you find a zero. If is a zero, then is a factor (factor theorem).   Can find zeros using your scientific calculator (if allowed) with TABLE mode.   List all of the potential roots to show your work (if required).   If the leading coefficient is 1, then all potential integer roots are the factors of the constant term (integral zero theorem).   If the leading coefficient is not 1, then the possible roots are all fractions of the form , where:   is a factor of the constant term  is a factor of the leading coefficient   (rational root theorem)      Divide out the factor, using synthetic division, so that the resulting polynomial has a degree 1 lower than originally.    Repeat the steps, until the resulting polynomial is quadratic.   You can stack multiple synthetic divisions together for conciseness.  If is a zero, it could still be a zero again (if it is a repeated zero).     Factor the quadratic. If it's not factorable, use the quadratic formula to check for potential irrational zeros.    Note: Also keep in mind other special factoring patterns, which can sometimes be used instead of synthetic divison:    Difference of squares, sum of cubes, difference of cubes.     Quadratic form (e.g. or ).    Factor by grouping.    Some remarks:   The order you find the factors doesn't really matter, in that any order will eventually lead you to the same final factored form. However, if testing zeros, it is often easier and more systematic to start from the simplest and smallest zeros, like 1 or , maybe 2 or , etc.  If you test a number and it is a root, it can still be a root again for the reduced polynomial (if it is a multiple root). However, if you test it and it's not a root, then you can skip that for the reduced polynomial.    "

  "body": " Applications of Polynomial Functions   Box Problem (Open-Top Box)  The box problem is a classic word problem in the polynomial functions chapter. The setup is complicated at first, but after you understand it, each problem goes pretty much the same way.   Open-Top Box from Cardboard   We are going to design a box with an open-top in the following way.    Start with a flat sheet of cardboard, of size 24 cm by 18 cm (the size varies for each question).    Cut out 4 square corners of equal size from the sheet.    Fold the 4 flaps of the sheets up, which forms the sides of the box (we tape together the sides).    The non-folded up part forms the base of the box.    It looks like this,        This creates a box, with an open top. If we cut out different lengths for the corner, the resulting box will have a different shape, and a different volume. Check out this Geogebra applet: Volume of a box problem . The is how much is cut from each corner (or the cut size). Then, the volume is a function of the cut size.     Find an expression for the volume of the box, as a function of the cut size. Find the domain of the problem.    First, the volume of a box is (length width height). If the cut size is , then the dimensions look like this,       The length is (because it is the starting amount of 24 cm, with cut off on both sides.    The width is (similarly).    The height is (because the cut size is the height of the flaps, which becomes the height of the box when folded up).    Therefore, the volume is,   Here is a graph of that function: Desmos graph . The cut size is on the horizontal axis, and the resulting volume is on the vertical axis.  For the domain, this function requires that is at most 9, because you can only cut off at most half of the width (18) from each side. Otherwise, you're cutting off the entire box (and more), which doesn't make sense. Also, of course, you must cut at least something off. Together, we have . If or , then the box has 0 volume. Some teachers might include these in the domain, as , for convenience.      Find the cut size(s), and the dimensions of the box, that produces a box with volume of .    To find when the volume is 560 cm , we set and solve for ,   Graphically, the solution(s) are the intersections of and the horizontal line ( Desmos link ). Observe that the intersections are at and . This means that both a cut size of 2 cm and 5 cm will produce a box with volume 560 cm .  Without a graphing calculator, we can solve the equation algebraically. First, expand and simplify,   Then, move all terms to one side, and write in standard form,   To make the equation simpler, divide out the common factor of 4,   To solve this, you can use:    The scientific calculator method, either using the cubic equation solver, or the table method.    Testing roots and synthetic division.    To test roots, try factors of 140, which are .  You should get,   And the solutions are . However, is outside the domain of the problem, so only are solutions.  After you get the solutions for , you can get the dimensions of the box by substituting that value of back into each dimension.    If , then we get,   Length cm.    Width cm.    Height cm.       If , then they are 14 cm, 8 cm, and 5 cm.    You can verify that for each case, the dimensions lead to a volume of 560 cm . Sometimes, your teacher might specify that, for example, , just so that there is a single final answer (in this case, ).      Find the maximum possible volume of the box, and the cut size that produces it (requires graphing calculator).    Graphically, the maximum value of the function is the top point of the graph ( Desmos graph ). Here, it is , which means the maximum volume is 655 cm , and this occurs when the cut size is 3.39 cm.     Each question of this type has basically the same setup, because the only things that can change are the dimensions of the sheet, and the desired volume.  In general, if the sheet has length and width , and the cut-out length is , then the volume of the box will be,    Box Problem Practice   For a cardboard sheet of each size, find the cut size and dimensions of the box that produce the desired volume.     Sheet 15 cm by 12 cm, volume of 162 (with ).    leads to , simplify to or and solve for .     (reject by the condition and by the domain restriction).      Sheet 36 cm by 20 cm, volume of 800 .    leads to , simplify to .     or (reject because it is outside the domain).      Sheet 20 cm by 28 cm, volume of 924 .    leads to , simplify to and solve for .     or (reject because it is outside the domain).      Sheet 36 cm by 28 cm, volume of 2240 .    leads to , simplify to and solve for .     or (reject because it is outside the domain).       Misc Word Problems   Consecutive Odd Integers   The product of 3 consecutive odd integers is 693. Find the 3 integers.    Leads to , or , solve for .    13, 15, 17.     Gift Box Dimensions   The volume of a gift box can be represented by the function , and its height is . Find expressions for the length and the width of the box.    The volume can be factored into length, width, and height. The height being means that is a factor, but we can use instead to make it simpler, and put the negative sign back after. This leads to factoring into .    The length and width are and .     Twin Ages Problem   Fred and Ted are twins. They were born 3 years after their older sister, Bethany. This year, the product of their three ages is 5726 greater than the sum of their ages. How old are the twins?    Leads to , leading to .    17 years old.      Remarks     Ideally, before factoring, you should divide out any common factor, to make the equation simpler. Especially if the numbers in the equation are very large, as they often are in applications.    In applications, it is rare to see polynomial equations with numbers that are simple and nice, unless your teacher has chosen the numbers specifically so it is simple.      "

Fold the 4 flaps of the sheets up, which forms the sides of the box (we tape together the sides).    The non-folded up part forms the base of the box.    It looks like this,        This creates a box, with an open top. If we cut out different lengths for the corner, the resulting box will have a different shape, and a different volume. Check out this Geogebra applet: Volume of a box problem . The is how much is cut from each corner (or the cut size). Then, the volume is a function of the cut size.     Find an expression for the volume of the box, as a function of the cut size. Find the domain of the problem.    First, the volume of a box is (length width height). If the cut size is , then the dimensions look like this,       The length is (because it is the starting amount of 24 cm, with cut off on both sides.    The width is (similarly).    The height is (because the cut size is the height of the flaps, which becomes the height of the box when folded up).    Therefore, the volume is,   Here is a graph of that function: Desmos graph . The cut size is on the horizontal axis, and the resulting volume is on the vertical axis.  For the domain, this function requires that is at most 9, because you can only cut off at most half of the width (18) from each side. Otherwise, you're cutting off the entire box (and more), which doesn't make sense. Also, of course, you must cut at least something off. Together, we have . If or , then the box has 0 volume. Some teachers might include these in the domain, as , for convenience.      Find the cut size(s), and the dimensions of the box, that produces a box with volume of .    To find when the volume is 560 cm , we set and solve for ,   Graphically, the solution(s) are the intersections of and the horizontal line ( Desmos link ). Observe that the intersections are at and . This means that both a cut size of 2 cm and 5 cm will produce a box with volume 560 cm .  Without a graphing calculator, we can solve the equation algebraically. First, expand and simplify,   Then, move all terms to one side, and write in standard form,   To make the equation simpler, divide out the common factor of 4,   To solve this, you can use:    The scientific calculator method, either using the cubic equation solver, or the table method.    Testing roots and synthetic division.    To test roots, try factors of 140, which are .  You should get,   And the solutions are . However, is outside the domain of the problem, so only are solutions.  After you get the solutions for , you can get the dimensions of the box by substituting that value of back into each dimension.    If , then we get,   Length cm.    Width cm.    Height cm.       If , then they are 14 cm, 8 cm, and 5 cm.    You can verify that for each case, the dimensions lead to a volume of 560 cm . Sometimes, your teacher might specify that, for example, , just so that there is a single final answer (in this case, ).      Find the maximum possible volume of the box, and the cut size that produces it (requires graphing calculator).    Graphically, the maximum value of the function is the top point of the graph ( Desmos graph ). Here, it is , which means the maximum volume is 655 cm , and this occurs when the cut size is 3.39 cm.    "

  "title": "Interval Notation",
  "body": " Interval Notation   In mathematics, we often work with ranges of numbers. A interval is a range of numbers between two points.  Mathematicians developed a notation to write intervals of numbers concisely and clearly. An interval is made up of:   Two numbers , that represent the start and end of the interval.  Round brackets or square brackets , that indicate if the numbers at the start or end are included or not.    For example,   means all numbers between 3 and 7, including both 3 and 7.     means all numbers between 3 and 7, but not including 3 nor 7.       The type of bracket tells you if the endpoint is included or not:   Square brackets indicate the endpoint is included.  Round brackets (or parentheses ) indicate the endpoint is not included (i.e. is excluded ).    For example,   means all the numbers from to 4, including but not including 4.     means all the numbers from to 4, not including but including 4.       Some intervals have no maximum value, no minimum value, or both. For an interval which has no endpoint, we say that it extends to infinity, and use as the endpoint. We use round brackets for or , since is not a real number, so they are not numbers we can include or reach in our interval.   For example,   For all the numbers greater than 4, not including 4 , we write .     For all the numbers less than or equal to 5 , we write .     For all numbers , we write .         Summary of Interval Notation  In summary,            (the entire real line)    In short, an interval is a shorthand notation for describing all numbers between two endpoints.   Put the smaller number first, and the bigger number second.  Use square brackets when the endpoint is included.  Use round brackets when the endpoint is not included, including for or .   Note that the notation for an interval is the same as a point in the -plane . This is an overloading of notation, however in most cases, the context should make clear which one it's referring to.   "

  "title": "Radian Measure",
  "body": " Radian Measure   There is another unit for measuring angles, called a radian , which turns out to be more useful than degrees to use in calculus. First, it is helpful to step back and understand the idea of how angles can be measured.    Alternate Angular Units  Degrees are a unit such that 360 degrees make a full rotation. This makes sense for practical applications, and historically, for navigation, architecture, and astronomy. This is because you can divide 360 evenly into many numbers. However, if we were starting from scratch, we could also consider alternate useful units of measuring angles. For example:    The gradian , where a quarter rotation is defined to be 100 gradians. Then, a full rotation would be 400 gradians.  Or, 1 turn could be defined as a full rotation. Then, a half rotation is turns, or a quarter rotation is turns.  For units inspired by the fact that there are 8 slices in a pizza, a unit could be called a slice , defined to be th of a full rotation. Then, 8 slices would be a full rotation.  We could define 1 unit to be a quarter rotation. Then, 4 units is a full rotation.    Notice that ultimately, units are a convention, and what units are useful or most natural depends on the context.    Motivation for Radians  There is another unit of angle measure, called a radian . The idea is that we will measure angles based on how long the arc of the angle is.       The longer the arc is, the bigger the angle that is swept out. The amount you rotate is proportional to how far you travel along the circle.    Small rotation small distance traveled  Big rotation big distance traveled         However, just measuring the arc doesn't fully work, because the arc length depends on the size of the circle (basically, it depends on it's radius).    If you have a small circle, you won't have to walk very far to make a full loop.  If you have a big circle, the same angle will mean you walk a lot farther.         We want a measurement which purely measures rotation, that isn't affected by how big the circle is. The key idea is: even though the arc length changes when the circle gets bigger or smaller, it changes in a very predictable way. In particular, arc length is proportional to the radius.    If you double the radius, the arc length doubles .  If you triple the radius, the arc length triples .      For example, for this particular angle below, for cm, the arc is 8 cm, and for cm, the arc is 16 cm.       While the arc lengths are different, in both scenarios, the arc length is 2 radius lengths.    To measure arc length, instead of using meters or centimeters or any other unit of length, we use the radius itself as the unit. In other words, we ask:   For example:    If the radius is 4 m, and the arc length is 12 m, that is radius lengths of rotation.  If the radius is 3 m, and the arc length is 15 m, that is radius lengths of rotation.         In other words, to measure the angle, divide the arc length by the radius length.    Radians    One radian is defined to be the angle at the center of a circle such that the arc length associated with it is equal to the radius of the circle,       More generally, an angle with associated radius and arc length is given by,     The symbol for radians is rad , however the symbol is often omitted. So, if an angle has no unit, it should be assumed to be radians (and for degrees, use ).        In fancy math language, you can say that the angle  subtends the arc, or the arc is subtended by the angle .  Radians are technically ``dimensionless\", because they are the ratio of two lengths.      Converting Between Degrees and Radians  Degrees and radians are both units of angles, so we can convert between them. To find an equivalence between the two, first recall that corresponds to a full rotation. In radians, for a full rotation, its arc length is simply the circumference of the circle, which is given by . Then, . Therefore, a full rotation is radians. This implies that,   To be a bit more simple, we can divide both sides by 2, since it is a common factor, to get,   This is a conversion factor which allows us to convert between these two angle units, analogous to how 1 inch = 2.54 cm, or how 1 hour = 60 minutes.   Converting between degrees and radians        The ratio can be thought of as a conversion factor, a ratio used to convert between units.    Convert to degrees.      Sketching Radian Angles in Standard Position  To graph an angle in radians, it's easiest to think in terms of fractions of . To start,    is a full rotation ( )  is a half rotation ( )         Then,    (or half of ) is a quarter rotation (half of a half rotation), which is  (or a quarter of ) is half of a quarter rotation, which is .  is split into 6 equal pieces, which is .         For bigger angles, we can count multiples.    For example, for , first divide into 6 equal pieces, and then count 5 of them,           Special Angles in Radians    "

  "title": "Quadratic Trigonometric Equations",
  "body": " Quadratic Trigonometric Equations   Some trigonometric equations are quadratic in a particular trigonometric function, in that they involve a trigonometric function being squared. In this way, many methods for solving quadratic equations can be used to solve trig equations.    Notation and Other Powers of a Trigonometric Function  Sometimes, we want to write the square of a trig function. For example, , or . It is common to write this more simply as .   Notation Example  For example, means . Then,    This convention saves space and avoids writing so many brackets with expressions that have many powers involving trigonometric functions. This notation applies in general to all trigonometric functions,   This all works the same with higher powers (e.g. ).  This notation often confuses students when first learning it. In particular, the exponent (2 in this case) applies to the entire trigonometric function, not the angle . In other words,   If you like, whenever you see a squared trig function, you can first write it with brackets, before starting with the problem.    Solving Quadratic Trigonometric Equations   Substitution Idea  Consider . To solve this, you can think of replacing with a single variable ( ), to get . To solve this, you would isolate for , and then take the square root of both sides.   More precisely, if is a quadratic equation, then the equation can be put into the form (or another trigonometric function).    Examples  Factor, and then solve the resulting two (linear) trigonometric equations.   Basic quadratic equation   Solve each equation for , and give the general solution.    .  Answer: .

General solution: OR or or .    .  Answer: . General solution: OR or or .    Note that you can't divide by (or any other trig function), because that assumes that , when in fact can equal 0. This is just like how with the equation , you can't divide by and instead have to factor it out.    Trigonometric Equations in Quadratic Form  Again, it is helpful to think about the equation if the trig function was replaced by a single variable (say, ).

  "title": "Intro to Proving Trigonometric Identities",
  "body": " Intro to Proving Trigonometric Identities    General Principles for Proving Identities      Convert all trigonometric expressions to sine and cosine . All trigonometric ratios can be written in terms of the ``basic\" trig ratios sine and cosine.   The one exception is if the entire identity only includes tangent and\/or cotangent, in which case it is usually simpler to convert everything in terms of tangent.     Start by manipulating the more complicated side . This is because is generally easier to go from something complex and simplify it, rather than go from something simple and make it more complex. In general,    Tangent is more complicated than sine and cosine  Reciprocal trigonometric functions are more complicated than primary trigonometric functions  Multiple fractions are easier to combine into one fraction, than writing one fraction as a combination of multiple fractions       Begin with the end in mind . Look at the form of the desired side before you start, and guide your work toward that structure.    Combine fractions using a common denominator.    Multiply by the conjugate, in order to use the Pythagorean identity.    Simplify complex fractions, by clearing denominators (multiply the numerator and denominator by the LCD).    Utilize algebraic identities, e.g. difference of squares, square of a sum, etc.     Use all trigonometric identities available to you.       Examples    Prove each trigonometric identity.     .    cancel.      .    simplify complex fraction, factor and cancel.      .    simplify complex fraction, factor and cancel.      .
