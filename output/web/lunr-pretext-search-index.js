  "body": " Rational Exponents and Radicals   Recall that previously, powers and exponents are a concise notation to write repeated multiplication. For example, means multiply 3, 4 times, or .  We can extend the definition of exponents to allow for exponents which are fractions (i.e. rational numbers). For example, expressions like,   At first, the previous definition of exponents as how many times you're multiplying doesn't seem to make sense. After all, for example, for , what does it mean to multiply 4 by itself 3\/2 times?   Suppose that we extend exponents to be allowed to be any rational number. Then, we want the laws of exponents to still work. In particular, the two fundamental laws,   Then, consider . By properties of exponents, we have,   This shows that multiplied by itself is equal to 3. In other words, . On the other hand, we know that multiplied by itself is equal to 3, or,   This means that and must be the same number, and so .   In general, for any number , if we multiply by itself, we get,   This means that , and so is the square root of .    Rational Exponents     In other words,   Technically, there are two numbers whose square is , which are and . We define to be the positive square root of .  In a similar way, for an exponent of , we have,   Therefore, , and so is the cube root of .   In general, this works for any exponent of the form .     Next, we want to define a rational exponent when the numerator is a number other than 1, like , or .   Consider . Recognize that is just , so,   And so . On the other hand,   And so . Putting both of them together, we get that all of these are equal,   and all of them are equal to 4.   In general,     This means that when raising a number to a fraction power ,    Take the th root and then raise to the th power.    Or: Raise it to the the th power and then take the th root.    In short,    Numerator exponent.    Denominator root index.    Some notes:    Decimal exponents can be thought of as fraction exponents. For example, .    Note that when evaluating expressions with rational exponents with a calculator, be sure to put parentheses around the fraction. Most calculators will evaluate as , because with order of operations, exponentiation is higher than division.    Note that this always works, except if is even and is negative, because we can't take the square root (or any even root) of a negative number.    We can also define negative rational exponents, in the same way as negative integer exponents.       Summary of Rational Exponents and Exponent Laws  In summary,   All of the laws of exponents also apply to rational exponents.    Exponent laws .      Converting Between Rational Exponents and Radicals    Write each expression in exponent form.                                              Write each expression in radical form.

  "body": " Factoring Quadratic Trinomials    Factoring quadratic trinomials is arguably the single most used skill in high-school mathematics, being used in uncountably many high-school (and college) math problems. In this way, it is a very important foundational skill to master. However, unfortunately, it is among the least important and least useful topics ``in the real world\".  The goal is to factor any expression of the form , where are any integers.   First, we'll start with a simpler case, when .  Then, we'll consider the more difficult case, when .     Factoring (Sum and Product Method)  We want to take an expression like , and rewrite it as . The question is: how to choose the two numbers to put in the brackets? Observe the pattern for how expansions work. For example, consider the expansion of ,   Here are some other expansions,   Observe how expanding the left side leads to the right side.   On the right side, there are always 3 terms: , an term, and a constant number term.  To get the coefficient of the middle term, you add the two numbers in the brackets.  To get the last constant term, you multiply those two numbers.   In other words,   In general, if we multiply two factors together, say and , we get,    The first term is always .  The coefficient of the middle term is the sum of and .  The last term is the product of and .   In summary,   This leads to a general rule for factoring an expression of the form .    Factoring  Consider,   We want two numbers that multiply to 12 and add to 7. There are many pairs of numbers that add to 7, so we'll start with numbers that multiply to 12. Our choices are:   Notice that if we choose 3 and 4, they also add to 7. So this is the correct combination. Then,     Factoring With Negative Numbers  Consider,   We want two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to . Here are the possible pairs of factors:   At first, it seems none of these add to . However, we can also have both of our numbers be negative, because two negative numbers also multiply to a positive. For example,   Then, and is the correct combination. Then,     Writing in Standard Form  Consider,   This is still a quadratic trinomial. At first glance, it's a bit different than the previous examples, because it's not written in the usual order for a quadratic. The highest power term, , is at the end instead of the beginning.  When factoring, you should always arrange the terms in the same order: first, next, and constant last. This is called descending power order (the exponent on from largest to smallest), and is often called standard form .   Now, it looks like a regular quadratic. We need two numbers that multiply to 12 and add to . After some guessing, the correct combination is and . Therefore,    In summary,   (If necessary) Arrange the trinomial in descending power order.  Find two numbers that multiply to (the last number), and check if they add to (the middle number).  If they do, then it factors as .    Practice Factoring Quadratics 1   Factor each quadratic expression.                                                                                                            Some additional helpful observations,   When the constant term is positive, then the factors of must be either both positive or both negative.  If the middle term is positive, then both must be positive. E.g. (last term is positive, middle term is positive, so both factors are positive)  If the middle term is negative, then both must be negative. E.g. (last term is positive, middle term is negative, so both factors are negative)    When the constant term is negative, then the factors of must have opposite signs (one positive, one negative). The sign of the larger number will be the sign of the coefficient of the middle term.  E.g. (last term is negative, so signs are opposite, and middle term is negative, so and 3 is negative)  E.g. (last term is negative, so signs are opposite, and middle term is positive, so and the 5 is positive)      Trinomial That Cannot Be Factored  In fact, not all trinomials can be factored. Consider . To factor this, we would need two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to 4. The options are: or . Neither of them work. This means that is not factorable.   Polynomials which cannot be factored are called prime , or irreducible . Prime in the same way as a prime number like 7 cannot be factored into smaller pieces, and irreducible similarly means not reducible . For now, problems will almost always have only factorable polynomials.   Practice Factoring Trinomials   Factor each trinomial.                                                                                                              Factoring Trinomials with Common Factors  Sometimes the trinomial is set up so that (the number in front of is not 1), however, there is a common factor that can be factored out, reducing the expression to one which can be factored using the previous method.   Factoring Completely   Factor each quadratic expression completely.                                              Factoring Polynomials of the form ,  There are many methods for factoring these kinds of polynomials. Different teachers will teach different methods. All of them end up with the same result, but some are more efficient than others.  Here, I will explain the cross method, because I personally believe it is the most efficient and easiest method to use.    The Cross Method   Introduction to the Cross Method  Consider,   To do the cross method,   Draw a crisscross or X shape underneath.  On the left side, put two things that multiply to the first term, and on the right, put two things that multiply to the last term.  Multiply each of the diagonals and add them up.  The combination is correct if the diagonals add up to the middle term.   For example,      On the left side, , and on the right, . However, the diagonals add up to , which isn't the middle term. Instead, switch the 3 and the 1,      We now get , which is the middle term. After you've found the correct combination, the two factors can be read horizontally in each row,        Cross Method With Negative Numbers  Consider,   Using the cross method, one possible combination is,      On the left side, , and on the right, . However, the diagonals add up to , which isn't the middle term, so this isn't correct. Instead, switch the 2 and the ,      Now the diagonals add to , which is not quite , but it's close. To fix it, just change the negative sign on the right to be on the 2 instead of the 1,      Now the diagonals add up to , which matches the middle term. Reading across gives the factors:        Cross Method With Multiple Factor Pairs  Consider,   For the left side, we have 6, which means we could choose 6 and 1, or 3 and 2. We don't know ahead of time which will be correct, so let's choose 6 and 1, and we can change it later.      The diagonals add up to , which is too large. Let's switch the 2 and 5,      Now the diagonals are , which is close but still not 19. Try different factor pairs of 10: and .      Now the diagonals are , still not enough. Switching gives,      Now we get , too large. We've tried all of the possible combinations on the right side, so this means that the left side is wrong. Let's try and instead.      Now the diagonals add to , perfect! Reading across gives,       The cross method requires some guessing and checking (or trial and error), especially at first. However, with some practice and gain experience, you'll become more experienced at making educated guesses for the combinations that are more likely to work, so you won't have to naively go through every single combination. Also, sometimes you get lucky and find the correct combination right away.   Using the Cross Method When  The cross method can also be used in the previous simpler case, when . For example, for,   We could think of factors of that add up to , which are and 4, to get,   However, we can also use the cross method. The first term is , so we can write and on the left side, and the last term is , so we can try and on the right side. Then, we draw a crisscross or X shape, multiply the diagonals, and add them up. The combination is correct if the diagonals add up to the middle term.       This gives the same answer as before.    Factor Out the Negative Sign First  Consider . In this case, which is negative, unlike the previous examples. You could continue just like before, by finding two things that multiply to and 3. For example,         However, it turns out that the negative sign on the left side makes things more complicated, because you have to worry about where to put the negative sign on the left side (in addition to the right side being either 3 and 1 or and ). There are a lot of negative signs, and it can get confusing.  Instead, it's better to first factor out the negative sign in the front. To do this, factor out from all terms, which basically flips the sign of all the terms,   Then, factor the expression inside the brackets as before. Now, you don't need to worry about the sign on the left column, and the only sign choice for the , where one of the numbers must be negative.        In general, if the value is negative, factor out from all terms first, and then factor the remaining polynomial.   Factor Out the GCF Before Using the Cross Method  Consider,   Here, we can still use the cross method. However, the numbers are kinda large, especially 30, which has many possibilities for its factors. After some trial and error, the correct combination is,      However, notice that also contains a common factor of 2, so to fully factor, we should factor it out also.   Alternatively, it is easier to first factor out the common factor of 2,   Then, factoring the remaining only uses the sum and product method (what multiplies to and adds to ), and has smaller numbers to work with. After some guessing, and 3 works,    In general, if there is a common factor among all of the terms, then you should first factor out the GCF (greatest common factor), before using the cross method. This makes the numbers you have to work with smaller, making it easier to find the factors.   Practice Factoring General Quadratics 1   Factor each expression fully.

If the leading coefficient (the number in front of ) is negative, factor out from all terms (basically, flip the sign of each term).       If ( ), find two numbers that multiply to and add to .  If ( ), use the cross method.     (Optional) To check your answer, you can expand (FOIL) and check if you get back the original expression.    "

  "body": " Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring   Previously, we learned:   If a quadratic equation is factored, then it is easy to solve.  How to factor quadratics in the form .   Combining these give us a powerful strategy for solving quadratic equations. First however, we need to make sure the equation is in the correct form,   This is called standard form , as it is the conventional, agreed-upon way to write a quadratic equation. This is because this form makes solving the equation consistent each time. To do this, move all terms to one side of the equation, and arrange the terms with the first, the term next, and the constant last.    Summary   (If necessary) Write in standard form, by moving all terms to one side so that the equation equals zero. E.g.   (If necessary) Look for common factors, if all terms share a common factor, divide it out first.  Factor the trinomial.  Find the value of that makes each factor 0.   Some notes:   If is a factor of the polynomial, then is a solution to the equation.  Always look for common factors, because it makes the problem more simple.

To solve the inequality, we don't need to graph the entire parabola precisely. Instead, we only need to find the roots, and know the basic shape (opening up or down).  A quadratic expression can only change sign at its roots. This means, if a quadratic has two roots, then:    If the quadratic is positive in one interval, it will switch to negative when crossing a root.    After crossing the second root, it switches back to positive.    If the quadratic opens down, then the pattern is reversed: it first is negative, then positive, then negative.

  "body": " Intro to Rational Expressions   Recall that a fraction, or rational number , is a number that can be written by dividing two integers (like , or ). A rational expression is similar, except with variables.    Rational Expressions    A rational expression is an algebraic expression of the form, In other words, it is the quotient of two polynomials.   It's also called an algebraic fraction , as opposed to a regular fraction which only involves numbers.      Identifying Rational Expressions  For example, these are all rational expressions,     ( , being just a constant, is still considered a polynomial)  (polynomials can have multiple different variables)   However, these are not rational expressions:   , because is not a polynomial.  , because is not a polynomial.     Polynomials as Rational Expressions  All polynomials are technically also considered rational expressions, because any polynomial can be written as itself divided by 1 (and 1 is a polynomial also). For example,      Non-Permissible Values  A rational expression is not defined if their denominator is 0, because division by zero is undefined. Values of (or whatever the variable is) that make the denominator 0 are called non-permissible values .    The non-permissible values ( NPV s) of a rational expressions are the values of the variable(s) that make the denominator 0.   Also called restrictions , or excluded values .     To determine the non-permissible values of a rational expression, figure out what values of will make the denominator 0.   Basic Non-Permissible Values  Find the non-permissible values of the rational expression,   This is when is equal to 0. You may be able to observe that this is when . Or, you can set equal to 0 and solve for . Therefore, the NPV is .   The purpose of NPVs is to communicate what values of the variable are not allowed to be plugged into the expression.   NPVs with Difference of Squares  Find the non-permissible values of,   The denominator is , so the NPVs are the values that make . To solve this, one way is to factor it as a difference of squares, then set each factor equal to 0 and solve for . Therefore, the NPVs are . Alternatively, you could take square roots,     No Non-Permissible Values  Find the non-permissible values of,   The denominator is , so the NPVs are when, To solve this, you may recognize that the left side is always positive, so it is never equal to 0, and so there is no solution. Or, isolate for , Then, there is no number such that (in other words, the equation has no solution), so the denominator is never 0. Therefore, there are no NPVs.    NPVs with Trinomial Factoring  Find the non-permissible values of,   The NPVs are when, We can factor, then set each factor equal to 0 and solve. Therefore, the NPVs are .    NPVs with Multiple Variables  Find the non-permissible values of,   The denominator is , so the NPVs are when, This is a product of two variables, so it is equal to 0 precisely when either or . Both of these make the denominator 0, so both must be excluded. Therefore, the NPVs are and .    NPVs with Common Factors  Find the non-permissible values of,   The NPVs are when, You can factor out a common factor of , then set each factor equal to 0 and solve for . Therefore, the NPVs are .    NPVs Using Quadratic Formula  Find the non-permissible values of,   The NPVs are when, In fact, this quadratic does not factor, so we must use the quadratic formula. Therefore, the NPVs are .   In summary, to find non-permissible values, find the zeros of the denominator, by setting it equal to 0 and solving for .  Note: the non-permissible values do not depend on what the numerator is at all , only on what the denominator is.   Practice Exercises   Find all non-permissible values (if any) for each rational expression.                 none                         ,             none         the quadratic does not factor      difference of squares      "

  "body": " Multiplying and Dividing Rational Expressions   Recall that to multiply fractions, we simply multiply their numerators together and their denominators together (separately). Also, after doing the multiplication, we can sometimes cancel common factors to reduce the fraction to lowest terms.   Multiplying Fractions Example  For example, to multiply by ,   Therefore, .   In general, the rule for multiplying fractions is,   Alternatively, we can cancel common factors before multiplying.   Cancelling Before Multiplying  For example, to multiply , we can cancel the on the top with the on the bottom, to make and ,    Rational expressions are multiplied in a similar way, by multiplying their numerators together and their denominators together.    Multiplying Rational Expressions    To multiply two rational expressions, multiply their numerators and multiply their denominators. That is, if are polynomials, then,   as long as and are not equal to 0.    For example,   However, if we first multiply and expand the expressions in the numerator and denominator, then the polynomials will get complicated and it will be more difficult to cancel common factors, in order to simplify. Instead, we want to factor each expression first, cancel common factors, and then multiply the result left over.    Factors in any numerator can be cancelled with factors in any denominator. In other words, we can cancel up and down but also diagonally .    Cancelling common factors result in 1.    A good strategy is to first focus on factoring (factor everything), then look for cancellations after.    Note: Multiplication can be denoted by or , and also sometimes by brackets. In other words, each of these means the same thing:       Dividing Rational Expressions  Recall that when dividing rational numbers, this is equivalent to multiplying by the reciprocal of the second number, and then multiply like before. You may remember this rule as keep, change, flip (meaning, keep the first fraction the same, change the sign to multiplication, and flip the 2nd fraction).   Dividing Fractions Example  For example, to divide ,   Therefore, .   In general,   Rational expressions are divided similarly, i.e. when dividing by a rational expression, multiply by its reciprocal.    To divide two rational expressions, multiply by the reciprocal of the denominator. That is, if are polynomials, then,   where are non-zero.    Remember: keep change flip.  Note that in addition to and having to be non-zero, also has to be non-zero, otherwise we are dividing by 0.

  "body": " Adding and Subtracting Rational Expressions   Adding rational expressions is similar to adding (numerical) fractions. Recall that to add fractions, you need to have the denominators be equal, and then you add the numerators.   Adding Two Fractions  For example, to add , we simply add the numerators, because the denominators are the same,    In general, if the denominators are the same (that is, we have a common denominator), then simply add the numerators together over that common denominator. That is,   If the denominators are not equal, then we need to first manipulate the fractions so that they have a common denominator.   Adding Two Fractions with Different Denominators  For example, to add , we have denominators of 9 and 3, so we can make a common denominator of 9, by multiplying by ,    Sometimes, to make a common denominator, you need to manipulate both fractions.   Adding Two Fractions with Different Denominators  For example, to add , we have denominators of 5 and 7, so we need a common denominator of (which is ),              Adding Rational Expressions   Adding Rational Expressions with Like Denominators  To add , add the numerators over the common denominator of ,     Adding Rational Expressions with Like Denominators  To add , add the numerators together over the common denominator of ,    To add two rational expressions with like denominators, add their numerators and keep the same denominator. That is, if are polynomials, then, with the restriction that cannot be equal to 0.  Sometimes, after adding, the result can be further simplified by cancelling common factors.   Adding Rational Expressions and Simplifying  For example,      Summary of Adding or Subtracting Rational Expressions    Factor the denominators completely.    Create a common denominator, by manipulating each fraction.    After you have a common denominator, add or subtract the numerators, and keep that common denominator.    Simplify if needed, by collecting like terms, and factor and cancel if possible.    Note: . For example, .

  "body": " Word Problems with Rational Equations   Some word problem situations lead to a rational equation. There are 3 broad categories of problems:   Work problems.  Rate\/speed problems.  Current\/wind problems.   These are very standard categories, so be sure to master each one. Also, review Word Problem Solving Strategy for learning how to think about word problems broadly.    Work Problems (Combined Work Rate)  In these problems, two people or machines work together at different rates to complete a task.   Painting a Wall  Alex can paint a wall in 4 hours. Brianna can paint the same wall in 6 hours. If they work together and do not stop, how long will it take them to paint the wall?  We want to find the time it takes for Alex and Brianna to paint the wall together, so let be the number of hours it takes them to paint the wall, working together.  Think about what happens as time passes. If Alex can finish 1 whole wall in 4 hours, then,   After 1 hour, he has finished of the wall.  After 2 hours, he's finished of the wall.  After 3 hours, he's finished .  In general, after hours, he has finished the fraction of the wall.   Similarly, Brianna can finish the wall in 6 hours, so,   After 1 hour, she's finished of the wall.  After 2 hours, she's finished .  And in general, after hours, she has finished of the wall.   Working together, after hours they have finished one whole wall, or 1 of the wall. Then,   Then,   Then, to solve this equation, clear the denominators by multiplying both sides by 12 (the LCD),   Therefore, together, they would take 2.4 hours. This is reasonable, because since they are working together, it will take somewhat less time than either of them working individually (4 hours or 6 hours).  Another way to organize this information is in a table, with 3 columns: the time it takes, the fraction done in 1 hour, and the fraction done in hours.   Another equivalent way to do this is to add the contributions after 1 hour, which gives,   This equation is equivalent to the previous equation, and so will also give the correct answer. However, I don't think it's as intuitive as the previous one.   In general,    Taps Filling a Tub  A cold tap can fill a tub in 2 minutes, and a hot tap can fill the same tub in 3 minutes.

Tom takes 4 minutes, Paco takes 2 minutes, Carl takes 5 minutes, and all three together take minutes.     Relative Speed Comparison Problems   Jess and Sarah  Jess can run 3 miles per hour faster than her sister Sarah can walk. If Jess ran 12 miles in the same time it took Sarah to walk 8 miles, what is the speed of each sister?  We want to find the speed of each sister, so we can let be the speed of one sister, and then the other one differs by 3. Let be Sarah's speed. Then, Jess's speed is 3 mi\/h more, so it's (Note that you could have instead let be Jess's speed, and then Sarah would be ). We know they took the same amount of time, so,   Then, remember how speed, distance, and time are related by (or , or ). We'll use here because we want time.   To solve, clear denominators by multiplying by (the LCD),   Therefore, Sarah's speed is 6 mi\/h, and Jess's speed is 3 mi\/h faster, so it is 9 mi\/h.   In general, remember that,    You may remember these relationships from this triangle (the distance speed time triangle, or DST triangle):       Cyclists Comparison  One cyclist averages 3 km\/h faster than a second cyclist.

Then, your speed upstream is , because the 2 km\/h current is pushing you backwards. Similarly, your speed downstream is , because the 2 km\/h current is helping you go faster. Then, the total time for the trip is 3 hours, so,   Then, to calculate time, use ,   To solve, multiply both sides by (the LCD),   We keep only the positive solution, because paddling speed can't be negative.

In general, we call this a polynomial function. So, linear and quadratic functions are specific types of polynomial functions.   Exploring Polynomial Graphs  Let's explore polynomial functions. We'll start with the most basic types, which are just a single power of . We can graph polynomial functions using Desmos.    Exploration of power functions . Consider the graphs of , , , , , . Observe the pattern in the shapes.  Even integer powers have a U-shape whereas the odd integer powers have an S-shape .    Power functions with negatives . Consider , , , , , . These are basically the previous graphs except upside down . In other words, a reflection over the -axis of the previous graphs.     functions with more terms . Consider adding terms with smaller exponents. Take a function that starts with , and add some terms like , , or a constant.       Observe that the first 3 all have the same S-shape, that starts in the bottom left and ends in the top right. The last 2 also share similar shapes, starting in the top left and ending in the bottom right. Observe that the negative sign in front basically reflects it upside down. The precise behavior of the function and how it goes up and down is much more complicated, however, and can't be determined just by looking at the equation.     functions with more terms . Let's do the same thing, but with an function.      Again, observe that they all have the same U-shape , and the ones with a negative in front are basically upside down.   In fact, you have seen this pattern before with parabolas (quadratic functions). Quadratic functions with various numbers . Recall that the number in front of (called the leading coefficient ) determines if it opens up or opens down . In particular, if it opens up, and if it opens down.   In summary,   The rough shape of a polynomial function is determined by the term with the highest power of .   In particular, it is based on:  The biggest exponent the polynomial has.  If the number in front is positive or negative.         Polynomial Functions  Basically, a polynomial function is made up of powers of , combined with numbers through multiplication, addition, and subtraction. Sometimes, we refer to them simply as polynomials.   Roughly, a polynomial function is a function made up of adding and subtracting powers of with whole number exponents.    The degree of a polynomial function is the exponent on its highest power of .  Intuitively, degree means size , the degree of a polynomial can be thought of as how big it is.      The term with the highest power of is called the leading term , and its coefficient is called the leading coefficient .  Intuitively, leading means most important or in front .       The domain of a polynomial is all real numbers, or (or, ). This is because it only uses the basic operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication of numbers, and these operations are always defined.  The graph of a polynomial function is both:    Smooth : it has no sharp corners.   Continuous : it has no breaks and can be drawn without lifting your pencil off the page.    Polynomial and Non-Polynomial Functions  Here are some functions which are polynomials, and some which are not.    is a polynomial, of degree 3, because all of the exponents are whole numbers.   is not a polynomial, because of the exponent of .   is not a polynomial, because it has the square root of .   is not a polynomial, because there is an in the denominator.   is a polynomial, intuitively because if you were to expand out all of the brackets, all of the powers of would be whole numbers.   Notice that all of the non-examples of polynomials either:   Don't have a domain which is all real numbers (they are undefined for some values of ), or,  Are not smooth (they have sharp corners) or not continuous (they have breaks).    Polynomials also have special names based on their degree.   Polynomials of degree 2 are called quadratic (which you've already learned before).  Polynomials of degree 3 are called cubic .  Degree 4 is quartic .  Degree 5 is quintic .  Degree 6 is sextic or hexic .   You can always just say degree 3 polynomial or degree 4 polynomial , but you should be aware of these terms. Typically, the higher the degree of the polynomial, the more complicated it is.    Turning Points of a Polynomial  A polynomial can have multiple points where it turns around , going from increasing to decreasing, or decreasing to increasing.   A linear function ( ) has 0 turning points (it never bends).  Quadratic ( ) has 1 turning point (the vertex).  Cubic ( ) has up to 2 turning points.  Quartic ( ) has up to 3 turning points.   It turns out that in general, a polynomial of degree can have at most turning points.    End Behavior of a Polynomial  As we've seen, the graph of a polynomial function can go either up or down on the left and right side, depending on its equation. This is called it's end behavior .   The end behavior of a function is its behavior as becomes large in either the positive or negative direction.   Graphically, end behavior is what the function does to the far right or far left side of the graph. The graph of a polynomial function may increase in some places and decrease in others, however it will eventually tend towards either going up or down .   Sometimes polynomial functions go right and up, sometimes they go right and down,  Sometimes they go left and up, and other times left and down.   The end behavior of a polynomial function is determined by the leading term. Intuitively, this is because when is large (either large positive, or large negative), the leading term dominates the other terms, in the sense that it's size is much bigger than the others. All other terms become insignificant in size.  In particular, the end behavior of a polynomial depends on both:   Its degree , being even or odd.  Its leading coefficient , being positive or negative.   It can be summarized in this table:    End behavior table     Some observations:   Even-degree polynomials have the same end behavior on each side.  Odd-degree polynomials have opposite end behavior.   Also,   For even-degree polynomials, the leading coefficient determines if it opens up or opens down (similar to a parabola).  For odd-degree polynomials, the sign of the leading coefficient determines the overall trend, if it overall has positive slope (like ) or negative slope (like ), (similar to a line).   There are a few ways to describe end behavior:   The simplest is just to draw that little sketch of how the arrows will go on the left side and the right side.   Another way is through the quadrants, which looks like this:  End behavior table      Remember that the quadrants are labelled starting from the top right, and going counterclockwise, like this:          y-Intercept of a Polynomial  Recall that the -intercept for linear and quadratic functions is simply the constant term,   This is because to find the -intercept, set , and solve for . Doing this makes all of the terms vanish, leaving only the constant term left. In general, the -intercept of a polynomial function is the constant term.   y-intercept Example  For , the -intercept is .     x-Intercepts (Zeros) of a Polynomial  For -intercepts, first note that the terms zero , root , and -intercept are all somewhat used interchangably. Zero and root are more truly synonyms, whereas -intercept typically refers to the point on the graph (where it touches the -axis).   A number is a zero or ( root ) of if . The following are equivalent:    is a zero of .   is a root of .   is an -intercept of the graph of .    Recall that to find -intercepts, you set , and solve for .   Finding x-intercepts  For , we get,   and we need to solve for . It is not obvious how to do this at first glance.   In general, the -intercept(s) of a polynomial function are the solutions to the equation .  We will explore various techniques to solve equations like this. Most of the examples will be simple, with numbers chosen very carefully so that the problem is solvable. In general, solving this equation by hand and exactly is very difficult, and sometimes actually impossible (and only possible approximately).   "

  "body": " Polynomial Zeros, Factored Form   Recall that a big part of analyzing quadratic functions was to be able to find their zeros, i.e. to solve quadratic equations. In a similar way, we want to find zeros of higher-degree polynomial functions.  However, this is not as easy. In fact, it is not even possible to do exactly in general for any given polynomial.  Recall that for quadratic equations, there are 3 main techniques:   Using technology (graphing).  Factoring.  Quadratic formula.   Unfortunately, there is no easy formula (similar to the quadratic formula) that can solve 3rd degree, 4th degree, or higher degree equations. This means that we will have to use factoring (by hand) or technology.    Zeros by Technology\/Graphing Calculator\/Desmos  The easiest way to find the zeros of a polynomial function is using technology. Graph the function using Desmos , and observe the -intercepts, which are the zeros.  However, you may not get the zeros in exact form, depending on if they are integers, fractions, or irrational numbers.    Solving Polynomial Equations in Factored Form  Recall that many quadratic equations were solved by factoring them and setting each factor equal to zero. If the quadratic in factored form, then finding its zeros is straightforward.   Solving a Factored Quadratic  For example,   We set each factor equal to zero:   So the solutions are and . Or, you might just read off the solutions from the equation itself.   You might recall that this is called the zero product property , which says that if the product of two numbers is 0, then one of the numbers must be equal to 0. In othre words, for 2 numbers and , if , then or . This is the fundamental property used to solve quadratic equations by factoring.  This idea generalizes to higher degree polynomials, with more than 2 terms.   Solving a Factored Cubic Polynomial  For example, consider this polynomial with 3 factors,   It is cubic, because it has 3 linear factors. If you were to expand it out, the highest power would be . To find the zeros, set :   Then each factor can be set to zero:   Solving gives:   Thus, the solutions are .    Solving a Factored Quartic Polynomial  Similarly, for this degree 4 (quartic) polynomial equation,   Setting each factor equal to zero gives:   Solving gives:     Factors Not in Standard Form  Sometimes the factors might not be written in the standard form. For example,   Setting each factor equal to zero:   Solving gives:   The solutions are .    Factors with Multiplicity  The exponents on the factors can also vary. For example,   However, it doesn't change the strategy. Set each factor to zero, giving,   And solve for ,   So the zeros are and .   In general, if you have a bunch of factors multiplied together that equals 0, then each of the factors can be 0. In this way, solving polynomial equations in this form is easy.   Zero product property  If the product of any number of factors is equal to zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero.   A polynomial written as a product of its factors is said to be in factored form .

Summary of Factoring Higher-Degree Polynomial Functions    (If necessary) Write the polynomial in descending power order.    Check for common factors. If there are any common factors, either a variable, number, or both. If so, factor out the greatest common factor (GCF).   e.g. .  e.g. .  If the leading coefficient is negative, factor out from all its terms.  Especially check if the numbers in the equation are big!     Find one factor, by testing potential zeros until you find a zero.

If the leading coefficient is 1, then all potential integer roots are the factors of the constant term (integral zero theorem).

Repeat the steps, until the resulting polynomial is quadratic.   You can stack multiple synthetic divisions together for conciseness.

Note: Also keep in mind other special factoring patterns, which can sometimes be used instead of synthetic divison:    Difference of squares, sum of cubes, difference of cubes.     Quadratic form (e.g. or ).    Factor by grouping.    Some remarks:   The order you find the factors doesn't really matter, in that any order will eventually lead you to the same final factored form. However, if testing zeros, it is often easier and more systematic to start from the simplest and smallest zeros, like 1 or , maybe 2 or , etc.  If you test a number and it is a root, it can still be a root again for the reduced polynomial (if it is a multiple root). However, if you test it and it's not a root, then you can skip that for the reduced polynomial.    "

The setup is complicated at first, but after you understand it, each problem goes pretty much the same way.   Open-Top Box from Cardboard   We are going to design a box with an open-top in the following way.    Start with a flat sheet of cardboard, of size 24 cm by 18 cm (the size varies for each question).    Cut out 4 square corners of equal size from the sheet.    Fold the 4 flaps of the sheets up, which forms the sides of the box (we tape together the sides).    The non-folded up part forms the base of the box.    It looks like this,        This creates a box, with an open top. If we cut out different lengths for the corner, the resulting box will have a different shape, and a different volume. Check out this Geogebra applet: Volume of a box problem . The is how much is cut from each corner (or the cut size). Then, the volume is a function of the cut size.     Find an expression for the volume of the box, as a function of the cut size. Find the domain of the problem.    First, the volume of a box is (length width height). If the cut size is , then the dimensions look like this,       The length is (because it is the starting amount of 24 cm, with cut off on both sides.    The width is (similarly).    The height is (because the cut size is the height of the flaps, which becomes the height of the box when folded up).    Therefore, the volume is,   Here is a graph of that function: Desmos graph . The cut size is on the horizontal axis, and the resulting volume is on the vertical axis.  For the domain, this function requires that is at most 9, because you can only cut off at most half of the width (18) from each side. Otherwise, you're cutting off the entire box (and more), which doesn't make sense. Also, of course, you must cut at least something off. Together, we have . If or , then the box has 0 volume. Some teachers might include these in the domain, as , for convenience.      Find the cut size(s), and the dimensions of the box, that produces a box with volume of .    To find when the volume is 560 cm , we set and solve for ,   Graphically, the solution(s) are the intersections of and the horizontal line ( Desmos link ). Observe that the intersections are at and . This means that both a cut size of 2 cm and 5 cm will produce a box with volume 560 cm .  Without a graphing calculator, we can solve the equation algebraically. First, expand and simplify,   Then, move all terms to one side, and write in standard form,   To make the equation simpler, divide out the common factor of 4,   To solve this, you can use:    The scientific calculator method, either using the cubic equation solver, or the table method.    Testing roots and synthetic division.    To test roots, try factors of 140, which are .  You should get,   And the solutions are . However, is outside the domain of the problem, so only are solutions.  After you get the solutions for , you can get the dimensions of the box by substituting that value of back into each dimension.    If , then we get,   Length cm.    Width cm.    Height cm.       If , then they are 14 cm, 8 cm, and 5 cm.    You can verify that for each case, the dimensions lead to a volume of 560 cm . Sometimes, your teacher might specify that, for example, , just so that there is a single final answer (in this case, ).      Find the maximum possible volume of the box, and the cut size that produces it (requires graphing calculator).    Graphically, the maximum value of the function is the top point of the graph ( Desmos graph ). Here, it is , which means the maximum volume is 655 cm , and this occurs when the cut size is 3.39 cm.     Each question of this type has basically the same setup, because the only things that can change are the dimensions of the sheet, and the desired volume.  In general, if the sheet has length and width , and the cut-out length is , then the volume of the box will be,    Box Problem Practice   For a cardboard sheet of each size, find the cut size and dimensions of the box that produce the desired volume.

Remarks     Ideally, before factoring, you should divide out any common factor, to make the equation simpler.

  "title": "Interval Notation",
  "body": " Interval Notation   In mathematics, we often work with ranges of numbers. A interval is a range of numbers between two points.  Mathematicians developed a notation to write intervals of numbers concisely and clearly. An interval is made up of:   Two numbers , that represent the start and end of the interval.  Round brackets or square brackets , that indicate if the numbers at the start or end are included or not.    For example,   means all numbers between 3 and 7, including both 3 and 7.     means all numbers between 3 and 7, but not including 3 nor 7.       The type of bracket tells you if the endpoint is included or not:   Square brackets indicate the endpoint is included.  Round brackets (or parentheses ) indicate the endpoint is not included (i.e. is excluded ).    For example,   means all the numbers from to 4, including but not including 4.     means all the numbers from to 4, not including but including 4.       Some intervals have no maximum value, no minimum value, or both. For an interval which has no endpoint, we say that it extends to infinity, and use as the endpoint. We use round brackets for or , since is not a real number, so they are not numbers we can include or reach in our interval.   For example,   For all the numbers greater than 4, not including 4 , we write .     For all the numbers less than or equal to 5 , we write .     For all numbers , we write .         Summary of Interval Notation  In summary,            (the entire real line)    In short, an interval is a shorthand notation for describing all numbers between two endpoints.   Put the smaller number first, and the bigger number second.  Use square brackets when the endpoint is included.  Use round brackets when the endpoint is not included, including for or .   Note that the notation for an interval is the same as a point in the -plane . This is an overloading of notation, however in most cases, the context should make clear which one it's referring to.   "

  "body": " Solving Radical Equations   A radical equation is an equation that contains square roots, cube roots, or any radical, with a variable inside it.  To solve equations with square roots, the key technique is to square both sides of the equation. Squaring and square rooting are basically inverse operations, so squaring can be used to undo or cancel out a square root.   Solving a Basic Radical Equation  Consider . Intuitively, we need to isolate , which is currently trapped inside of the square root. To get it out, we first square both sides of the equation, which cancels the square root,   Then, we can solve the equation just like a regular basic equation, by isolating for ,     An Equation with No Solution  Solve . Notice that the right hand side is negative. On the other hand, the left hand side is a square root, which is never negative. So this equation can never be true. We can conclude immediately that there is no solution, without any squaring or other algebra steps.  If you did square both sides, you would get,   which appears to be a solution, but in fact, it will be extraneous.    In general, if you have,   you can stop right away, and conclude there is no solution. Any solution that comes from squaring the equation will always be extraneous.    Solving Basic Square Root Equations   Isolate the radical (if necessary).  Square both sides of the equation (to cancel out the square root).  Solve the equation.

This can happen because squaring an equation can introduce new solutions. For example,     is false, but after squaring, we get , which is true.    Consider the (very simple) equation . This has one (true) solution which is (because replacing with 2 gives , which is true). However, if you square both sides, you get , which has 2 solutions ( and ).    Basically, squaring gets rid of negative signs, which can lead to more solutions.   These solutions, which appear when solving algebraically, but don't actually satisfy the original equation, are called extraneous solutions. Intuitively, extraneous means extra .  In general, for radical equations, you need to check your answers to see if they satisfy the original equation.

Simplify, and solve the resulting equation. If the equation still contains a square root, repeat the previous steps (isolate, square, simplify).   When there are no radicals left, typically the resulting equation will be a quadratic equation, so if needed, review the techniques for solving quadratic equations.

Solving Exponential Equations Using Common Bases  Some simple exponential equations can be solved by using the intuitive fact that if two powers with the same base are equal, then their exponents must be equal. In other words,   This means that if we can write both sides of an exponential equation as a power of the same base, then we can set their exponents equal ( equate exponents ), resulting in a simpler equation that we can solve.    Rewrite both sides using a common base.    Simplify using exponent laws.    Set the exponents equal.    Solve the resulting equation.    The resulting equation could be linear, quadratic, or some other type of equation.  Sometimes, both sides can be written as a power of multiple numbers, which result in the same solution.

Now reverse the question. Instead of asking what equals, ask: 10 to what power equals 1000? Since , the answer is 3.  Logarithms are a shorthand for this reverse question. The expression (read this as log base 10 of ) means the exponent you put on 10 to get . Intuitively, is the number of 10s you need to multiply together in order to get . So, for example, In other words,  Powers convert exponents to numbers  Logs convert numbers to exponent .  In this way, logarithms are a kind of inverse of exponents.    Approximating Logarithms  We know that for the equation , the answer is , because . However, what about the equation ?  We know that and , so we expect the solution to be between 3 and 4. Maybe a better guess is in the middle, like . Here, , which is a bit more than 11. Try , and we get , which is a bit less than 11. So, the solution is between 3.4 and 3.5.  Using logarithms, we can say that the exact answer is (read this as log base 2 of 11 ), which means the exponent you must put on 2 to get 11. It turns out that .  You can try this on your calculator. You'll see that , which is very, very close to 11.    Logarithm Examples  Similarly,  , because .  , because .  , because       Logarithms  The logarithm base b of a , denoted by , is the exponent that must be raised to, to get . In other words,      The equations ( logarithmic form ) and ( exponential form ) are two ways of expressing the same relationship between the numbers , and .  With the logarithmic form ,  is called the base of the logarithm.  is called the argument (the value inputted into the function).  is the logarithm (since it equals the logarithmic expression).  With the exponential form ,  is also the base .  is the exponent .  is the result of the power.  Notice that the exponent is equivalent to the logarithm above (since logarithms are an exponent), and that the result is equivalent to the argument above.   Converting Forms  Convert each logarithmic or exponential equation to exponential or logarithmic form.                                       Logarithms are a name for a certain exponent. In particular, is the exponent to which must be raised, to obtain .  When you see , mentally translate into the exponent you'd put on the base to get what's inside .

Base , called the natural logarithm , which is often used in calculus.  These are often denoted by simply and , respectively. In other words, These two logarithms are included on most calculators. The natural logarithm is denoted by because it is an abbreviation of the Latin term logarithmus naturali .   In computer science, often log base 2 is used, or .    For logarithms, we use three letters to denote the common logarithm, and two letters to denote the natural logarithm.  Typically, functions have been represented by a single letter, such that for or for .  In this way, or represents a function just like does. However, we often write logarithms without parentheses as or .  If you have seen the trig functions like or , then is a similar kind of notation: means the log function with as its input, just like means the sine function with as its input. In particular, does not mean times 10 , just like doesn't mean times 30 .  If a log contains more than one term, then we use brackets. For example, . Or, if there are a lot of factors, e.g. .

Similarly         Logarithm of the base   Because, the exponent you need to put on to get is 1.    Logarithm of One  Consider . This means the exponent to put on 3 to get 1. This is 0, because . Similarly,         Logarithm of 1   Because, the exponent you need to put on to get 1 is 0.     Evaluating Logarithms (By Hand)   Evaluating Logarithms  Evaluate each logarithm.        -1     4     -3     -3                                 -2         -4         -3         0     1      Logs of Negative Numbers  It turns out, we can't take the logarithm of a negative number, or 0.   Log of a Negative Number  Consider . This number represents the exponent to put on 2 to get . However, the equation has no solution, because 2 to the power of any number will always result in a positive number, never a negative.    Log of Zero  Consider . This also doesn't work, because has no solution. Again, 2 to the power of any number will always be positive, and so will never equal to 0.   In general, This is because for any base , the expression means the exponent needed to raise to get . Since to the power of any number is always positive, there is only an answer if is positive.    Evaluating Logarithms Using a Calculator  My recommended calculator Casio fx-991ES Plus C 2nd edition (or some other similar scientific calculators, as well as the TI-84 Plus CE) can calculate logarithms of any base.  However, many older and weaker calculators only have buttons for:  Base 10 (common logarithms) denoted by the key  Natural logarithms (base ) denoted by  In fact, base 10 logs are enough to evaluate logs of any base, because of this rule, This allows us to change a log of any base ( ) to something involving logs base 10. It also works for natural logarithms, but you can just stick with logs base 10.   Change-of-base property     Using Change of Base  For example,   (we could have found this one without a calculator)     This equality is a particular case of what is called the change-of-base property, which we'll explore further later on.    Inverse Properties of Logarithms   Logarithm of a Power  Consider . This means the exponent that 3 must be raised, to get . The answer is 5, because literally, 3 to the 5 is 3 to the 5. Similarly,        In general, if you take the log of a power of the base, the answer is the exponent.   Logarithm of a power of the base   Intuitively, is the exponent to put on to get , which is literally .    Power of a Logarithm  Consider . The exponent of represents the exponent to put on 4 to get 11. We are taking 4 to the power of this number, so by definition, we should get 11. Therefore, .  Similarly,         Power of a logarithm with the same base   Intuitively, is the exponent which must be raised to get . So, if we raise to that exponent, we get (literally) .    Evaluating with Inverse Properties  Evaluate each expression.    5     9     8     17     3     19     5     25                  Solving Basic Logarithmic Equations (Finding the Unknown)  To solve for an unknown that involves logs, the main technique is to convert to exponential form.   Solving Equations  Solve each equation.                                                                           In the next examples, if there are multiple logs inside each other, then work from the outside in. Convert to exponential form to unwrap one layer.   Advanced Examples  Solve each equation.                                (note: reject , because the base cannot be negative)     "

Radians are a unit of angles such that,     In other words,   radians is a half-rotation.  radians is a full rotation.       The symbol for radians is rad , however the symbol is often omitted. So, if an angle has no unit, it should be assumed to be radians (and for degrees, use ).   The equivalence can be thought of as a conversion factor, a ratio to convert between these two angle units (analogous to how 1 inch = 2.54 cm, or how 1 hour = 60 minutes).    Converting Between Degrees and Radians    Converting between degrees and radians .        Angle Conversion Practice   Convert each angle from degrees to radians or radians to degrees.    to radians    to degrees    to degrees      Sketching Angles in Radians  To graph an angle in radians, it's easiest to think in terms of fractions of . To start, recall that:   is a full rotation ( )  is a half rotation ( )   Then,   (or half of ) is a quarter rotation (half of a half rotation), which is .  (or a quarter of ) is half of a quarter rotation, which is .  is split into 6 equal pieces, which is .  is split into 3 pieces, which is .    Special-angle arcs on the unit circle.                 For bigger angles, we can count multiples of those smaller angles .   Sketching 2pi\/3  For , first divide into 3 equal pieces, and then count 2 of them counterclockwise,       Sketching 5pi\/6  For , first divide into 6 equal pieces, and then count 5 of them (counterclockwise),       Sketching 7pi\/4  For , first divide into 4 equal pieces, and then count 7 of them counterclockwise,       Sketching Practice   Sketch each angle in standard position.               Motivating Radians  Here, we will step back and explore the intuition behind radians, and how they come about to measure angles.   Alternate Angular Units  First, it is helpful to step back and understand the idea of how angles can be measured.  Degrees are a unit of rotation such that 360 degrees make a full rotation. They are useful practical applications (historically, for navigation, architecture, and astronomy), because you can divide 360 evenly into many numbers (like 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, etc.), so many common angles have whole number values (like , etc.).  However, if we were starting from scratch, with no prior knowledge of degrees, we could consider other useful units of measuring angles. For example:   The gradian , where a quarter rotation is defined to be 100 gradians. Then, a full rotation would be 400 gradians.  Or, 1 turn could be defined as a full rotation. Then, a half rotation is turns, or a quarter rotation is turns.  For units inspired by the fact that a pizza has 8 slices, a unit could be called a slice , defined to be th of a full rotation. Then, 8 slices would be a full rotation.  We could define 1 unit to be a quarter rotation. Then, 4 units is a full rotation.   Ultimately, units are a convention, and what units are useful or most natural depends on the context.   With radians, the idea is that we will measure angles based on how long the arc of the angle is.     The longer the arc is, the bigger the angle that is swept out. The amount you rotate is proportional to how far you travel along the circle.   Small rotation small distance traveled  Big rotation big distance traveled      However, just measuring the arc doesn't fully work, because the arc length depends on the size of the circle (basically, it depends on it's radius).   If you have a small circle, you won't have to walk very far to make a full loop.  If you have a big circle, the same angle will mean you walk a lot farther.      We want a measurement which purely measures rotation, that isn't affected by how big the circle is. The key idea is: even though the arc length changes when the circle gets bigger or smaller, it changes in a very predictable way. In particular, arc length is proportional to the radius.   If you double the radius, the arc length doubles .  If you triple the radius, the arc length triples .    Arc Length Proportionality  For example, for this particular angle below, for cm, the arc is 8 cm, and for cm, the arc is 16 cm.     While the arc lengths are different, in both scenarios, the arc length is 2 radius lengths.   To measure arc length, instead of using meters or centimeters or any other unit of length, we use the radius itself as the unit. In other words, we ask:   For example:   If the radius is 4 m, and the arc length is 12 m, that is radius lengths of rotation.  If the radius is 3 m, and the arc length is 15 m, that is radius lengths of rotation.      In other words, to measure the angle, divide the arc length by the radius length.    Radians  In short, radians measure angles based on how long the arc associated with the angle is, in terms of radius lengths.    One radian is defined to be the angle at the center of a circle such that the arc length associated with it is equal to the radius of the circle,     More generally, an angle with associated radius and arc length is given by,      In fancy math language, we often say that the angle  subtends the arc, or the arc is subtended by the angle .  Radians are technically dimensionless , because they are the ratio of two lengths.    "

  "title": "Alternate Angular Units.",
  "body": " Alternate Angular Units  First, it is helpful to step back and understand the idea of how angles can be measured.  Degrees are a unit of rotation such that 360 degrees make a full rotation. They are useful practical applications (historically, for navigation, architecture, and astronomy), because you can divide 360 evenly into many numbers (like 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, etc.), so many common angles have whole number values (like , etc.).  However, if we were starting from scratch, with no prior knowledge of degrees, we could consider other useful units of measuring angles. For example:   The gradian , where a quarter rotation is defined to be 100 gradians. Then, a full rotation would be 400 gradians.  Or, 1 turn could be defined as a full rotation. Then, a half rotation is turns, or a quarter rotation is turns.  For units inspired by the fact that a pizza has 8 slices, a unit could be called a slice , defined to be th of a full rotation. Then, 8 slices would be a full rotation.  We could define 1 unit to be a quarter rotation. Then, 4 units is a full rotation.

  "body": " Quadratic Trigonometric Equations   Some trigonometric equations are quadratic in a particular trigonometric function, in that they involve a trigonometric function being squared. In this way, many methods for solving quadratic equations can be used to solve trig equations.    Notation and Other Powers of a Trigonometric Function  Sometimes, we want to write the square of a trig function. For example, , or . It is common to write this more simply as .   Notation Example  For example, means . Then,    This convention saves space and avoids writing so many brackets with expressions that have many powers involving trigonometric functions. This notation applies in general to all trigonometric functions,   This all works the same with higher powers (e.g. ).  This notation often confuses students when first learning it. In particular, the exponent (2 in this case) applies to the entire trigonometric function, not the angle . In other words,   If you like, whenever you see a squared trig function, you can first write it with brackets, before starting with the problem.    Solving Quadratic Trigonometric Equations   Substitution Idea  Consider . To solve this, you can think of replacing with a single variable ( ), to get . To solve this, you would isolate for , and then take the square root of both sides.

  "body": " Intro to Proving Trigonometric Identities   We already know a few fundamental trigonometric identities. Using these, we can prove new and more complicated identities.  Proving a trigonometric identity involves manipulating one side of the equation algebraically, to show that both sides of the equation are equivalent.    Verifying a Trigonometric Identity by Graphing  A simple way to verify if an equation is an identity is to graph both sides using a graphing calculator, like Desmos .  If an equation is an identity, then both sides of the equation will be equal for all values of the variable, and so the graph of each side will coincide (i.e. overlap each other).    If both graphs overlap completely, the equation is an identity.    On the other hand, if the two graphs don't match at even a single point, then the equation is not an identity.     Desmos Verification   Verify that using a graphing calculator. Observe how they coincide (overlap): Desmos graph .      Verifying Identities    Verify for .      General Principles for Proving Identities  This topic is often considered one of the most challenging by students, because:    It involves a culmination of a variety of algebra techniques learned over the course of high school math.    It requires some creativity and ingenuity to choose a strategy.    It is more abstract, symbolic reasoning, with basically no visualizations.    Here are some general principles:     Rewrite everything in terms of sine and cosine . All trigonometric ratios can be written in terms of the basic trig ratios sine and cosine.     The one exception is if the entire identity includes only tangent and\/or cotangent, in which case it is usually simpler to convert everything in terms of tangent.     Start with the more complicated side . In general,    Tangent is more complicated than sine and cosine.    Reciprocal trig functions are more complicated than primary trig functions (sine, cosine, tangent).    Multiple terms are more complicated than a single term.    You want to start with the more complicated side, because it is easier to start from something complex and simplify it, rather than start from something simple and make it more complex.     Begin with the end in mind . Look at the form of the desired side before you start, and guide your work toward that structure. Especially helpful if you are stuck and unsure how to continue.    Here are some particular algebraic tactics:    Combine fractions, using a common denominator.    Simplify complex fractions, by clearing denominators (multiply the numerator and denominator by the LCD).    Use algebraic identities, e.g. difference of squares, square of a sum, etc.   For example,    .    .      Convert to or vise versa, using the Pythagorean identity:     Multiply by the conjugate, in order to use the previous strategy (Pythagorean identity). Particularly if you see .    Use all trigonometric identities available to you. When practicing, have a list of them for reference, and you'll naturally be more comfortable with them over time.

  "title": "Sum and Difference Identities",
  "body": " Sum and Difference Identities   The sum identities say that if you know about two angles and , you can also find sine (or cosine, or tangent) of the two angles added together . The difference identities do the same for the difference (subtraction) .   These identities are maybe the most challenging to remember at first, so definitely keep them available when practicing.  The 6 identities can be written more concisely as,   Notice that for cosine and tangent, the left has while the right has a sign, which means that on the left goes with on the right, and on the left goes with on the right.    Finding Exact Values Examples  The sum and difference identities can be used to find trigonometric ratios (like sine, cosine, and tangent) for several angles not typically found on the unit circle (i.e. not just and their multiples).   Cosine of 105 Degrees  Find . We can calculate this, because is the sum of two special angles (which we know about). Then, the sum identity for cosine says,   This answer is correct, however we can continue to simplify the result into one fraction,   Therefore, .    Tangent of 5 Pi over 12  Find . Here, after some trial and error, . Then,   This answer is correct, however we can continue to simplify the result,   This is a solid final answer. However, some instructors will expect that you rationalize the denominator to fully simplify,   Therefore, .   This works for any angle which can be written as the sum of two special angles (or the difference of two special angles). Here are some of the common ones.        Notice that there is often more than one way to write it (but maybe there is one easier way). For example, , but also . Also, in radians,         Evaluating Trigonometric Ratios   Evaluate each trigonometric ratio exactly, and simplify your answer.

  "title": "Solving Equations Graphically",
  "body": " Solving Equations Graphically   Graphing calculators, like Desmos , or the TI-84 Plus CE, can solve equations graphically very easily. The basic idea is to graph both sides of the equation, and the solutions are the intersection points.    Solving Equations Using a Graphing Calculator (Intersections)   Solving by Intersection  Solve the equation . To do this, graph both sides of the equation, and ( Desmos graph ). Observe the intersection points are at and . You can check that these are solutions, by plugging in and and verifying that both sides are equal,   Intuitively, this is because the equation is asking,  For which values of do the two expressions give the same number?  Then, a point is an intersection if it lies on both graphs, meaning that for that particular -value, the value for the left side is the same as the -value for the right side. That's what it means for the two sides of the equation to be equal.   In general, we want to solve an equation of the form,   where are expressions involving (that represent the two sides of the equation).   Graph both and .  The solutions are the -values of any intersection points of the two graphs.   In short,     Solving Numerically by Finding Zeros (Reducing to One Graph)  In fact, there is a slightly easier way. The general problem of solving an equation of the form,   can be rewritten by moving everything to one side (say, subtracting from both sides), to get . Then, the equation is in the form of one function equal to 0,   where . This transforms the problem from solving an equation with two separate sides, to finding the root of a (single) function. Then, to solve,   Graph .  The solutions are the -intercepts (zeros) of the graph.   In other words,     Comparing the Two Methods  Both the intersection method and the zeros method are mathematically equivalent, in that both will give you the same answer. However, there are some advantages and disadvantages to each, both practically and conceptually.    The intersection method is more intuitive, because you can visually see where the two functions intersect. If the functions represent some quantity, then it also has a useful interpretation.   Interpretating Intersection  For example, if represents how far each object has gone in seconds, then the intersection point means that after seconds, both objects have travelled the same distance . In contrast, with the zeros method, the -coordinate is always 0 and has no interpretation.     The zeros method is more computationally simpler, because you only have one function. Graphically, you only have to look near the -axis to find solutions. This is especially helpful when the functions are huge, and so you'd have to zoom out a lot to see the intersections.   Solving with the Zeros Method  Solve the equation . Using the intersection method , there is 1 intersection visible, but there is another intersection that is only visible if you zoom out a lot. Instead, using the zeros method, move all terms to one side, to get . Then, graphing this function , you can more easily see the 2 zeros of the graph, which are the solutions.       Solving Equations Graphically on the TI-84 Plus CE  With the TI-84 Plus CE, the strategy is similar to using Desmos, except it requires a few more button presses. Again, you can either do the intersection method ( ) or the zeros method ( ).   Enter the functions : Press [Y=] to to to the function editor. Enter the left side of the equation in Y1 and the right side in Y2. For example, for the equation , put in Y1 and in Y2. If solving , enter the expression in Y1 (and leave Y2 blank).  Adjust the window (if needed): Press [WINDOW] to set appropriate viewing bounds for Xmin, Xmax, Ymin, and Ymax so the graph and intersection points are visible. You can use [ZOOM] 6 (ZStandard) for a default view.  Graph the functions : Press [GRAPH] to display the graphs.   Find the intersection or root : Press [2nd] [TRACE] (CALC menu), then select 5: intersect (for intersection of two functions) or 2: zero (for roots of a single function). It will ask you to set a lower bound (Left Bound?) and upper bound (Right Bound?). These bounds define the interval for where the calculator will search for the solution, so make sure it's between them. Move the cursor with the arrow keys, and press [ENTER] for each.  It will also ask for a Guess?, which doesn't really matter, you can just press [ENTER] again (technically, the guess helps refine the search, but it only really helps for complicated functions that have many roots which are close together).

  "title": "Solving Equations Numerically with a Calculator",
  "body": " Solving Equations Numerically with a Calculator   A large amount of high school mathematics is about solving equations. You learn various techniques to solve equations by hand (also called solving algebraically ), which work for various types of equations. However, for many types of equations, there is no algebraic technique that can solve them.   For example, in fact, these equations can't be solved algebraically:      No matter how hard you try to manipulate the equation, factor, and isolate for , you won't be able to solve for exactly.  If you have learned about exponential functions, logarithmic functions, and\/or trigonometric functions, here are some more examples:          These equations are simple to write down, but none of them can be solved algebraically. More generally, most equations with a combination of exponentials, polynomials, and trigonometric functions are unsolvable algebraically.   In this case, the next best thing is to find an approximate numerical solution.  These make up the two broad approaches to solving equations:     Algebraic \/ analytic \/ exact methods : Manipulating the equation using algebraic rules, to isolate the variable, and find an exact solution.     Approximate \/ numerical methods : Finding a solution which is an approximate decimal number, that is close enough.    Numerical solutions are useful in a few situations:   If an exact solution can't be found (it's just impossible).  If an exact solution is possible but just really difficult to find (especially in applications, an approximate numerical answer is usually good enough)  If you've already solved algebraically, and you want to check that your final answer is correct.     Solving Using a Scientific Calculator  My recommended calculator Casio fx-991ES Plus C 2nd edition (or some other similar scientific calculators) can solve equations numerically. This is truly powerful, because you can check your solutions to any equation.    First, make sure you're in COMP (computation) mode (which is the regular mode), by pressing MODE , then select COMP .    Enter your equation. Use the ALPHA button to get X (look for the button that has X above it). For the sign, use ALPHA then CALC .    Start the SOLVE function, by pressing SHIFT , then CALC .    Provide an initial guess for , such as , then press .    View the solution. The calculator shows the value of . It also displays (left side minus right side), which will be 0 (or at least very close to ) if the solution is accurate.     Solving a Radical Equation  For example, to solve ,    Enter .    Select SOLVE , by pressing SHIFT , then CALC .    Enter an initial guess, like , and press .    The solution should be .     If the solution is not a nice number (like a whole number), the solution will be a decimal like , not symbolic like .    If is anything but 0 (or very close to it), then the calculator couldn't find the solution. Try a different guess.    The initial guess kinda matters, but most reasonable guesses should give you the correct answer. Here are some broad principles:    Ideally, try to give a good guess as you can. For example, a number close to the solution you got from solving by hand.    If there are multiple solutions, the calculator will only give you one of them (each time). This is because the calculator basically pulls your initial guess towards the closest solution. E.g. if the solutions are and , and your initial guess is , you will most likely get . Whereas if you choose initial guess of , you will get .    If you have no idea what the solution should be, try 0 or 1 as a default. Because many equations have solutions near 0.    This feature is truly powerful, because you can check your solutions to any equation.    If the calculator agrees with your algebraic steps, then you know your answer is correct.    If it gives a different solution than what you found, then you know you have a mistake somewhere, and can go back and try to find it. E.g. maybe you dropped a negative sign, or didn't collect like terms properly.    You can also use it to solve an equation if you are stuck, however most tests will require you to show your work as well.   "
