  "body": " Rational Exponents and Radicals   Recall that previously, powers and exponents are a concise notation to write repeated multiplication. For example, means multiply 3, 4 times, or .  We can extend the definition of exponents to allow for rational numbers, i.e. exponents which are fractions. For example, expressions like, At first, the previous definition of exponents as ``how many times you're multiplying\" doesn't seem to make sense. After all, for example, for , what does it mean to multiply 4 by itself ``3\/2\" times?   Suppose that we extend exponents to be allowed to be any rational number. Then, we want the laws of exponents to still work. In particular, the two fundamental laws, Then, consider . By properties of exponents, This shows that multiplied by itself is equal to 3, or . We also know that, This means precisely that and must be the same number, or .   In general, for any number , which means that , and so is the square root of .    Rational Exponents       In other words,     Technically, there are two numbers where, if you square them, give , which are and . We define to be the positive square root of .  In a similar way, for an exponent of , Therefore, , and so is the cube root of .   In general, this works for any exponent of the form .       Next, suppose we want to define a rational exponent when the numerator is a number other than 1.  For example, . In this case, , so, And so . On the other hand, And so . Putting both of them together, we get that all of these are equal,   This suggests the following definition, in summary.       For raising a number to a fraction power ,    Take the th root and then raise to the th power, or,    Raise to the the th power and then the th root    In short,    Numerator exponent.    Denominator root index.      Decimal exponents can be thought of as fractions. For example, .     Note that when evaluating expressions with rational exponents with a calculator, be sure to put parentheses around the fraction. Most calculators will evaluate as , because with order of operations, exponentiation is higher than division.    Note that this always works, except if is even and is negative, because we can't take the square root (or any even root) of a negative number.     We can also define negative rational exponents, in the same way as negative integer exponents.           Summary of Properties of Exponents  In summary,   All of the laws of exponents also apply to rational exponents.         Converting Between Rational Exponents and Radicals   Write each expression in exponent form.                Write each expression in radical form.           Write each expression in radical form in 2 ways.           Evaluating Rational Exponents Exact Values Examples   Evaluate each power, as a whole number or rational number, without using a calculator.                                              Rational Exponents Using a Calculator   Evaluate each expression using a calculator. Express your answers to four decimal places, if necessary.                        Simplifying Algebraic Expressions with Rational Exponents   Simplify each expression using exponent laws. Write with rational exponents where necessary.                                   "

Any number can be written as the square root of its square. For example, , . Similarly, any number can be written as the cube root of its cube, or in general the th root of its th power. This property, along with the multiplication property, can be used to condense mixed radicals into entire radicals.

  "title": "Factoring Quadratic Trinomials",
  "body": " Factoring Quadratic Trinomials   Factoring quadratic trinomials is arguably the single most used skill in high-school mathematics, being used in uncountably many high-school (and college) math problems. In this way, it is very important to master. However, unfortunately, it is among the least important and least useful topic \"in the real world\".  The goal is to factor any expression of the form , where are any integers.    First, we'll start with a simpler case, when .  Then, we'll consider the more difficult case, when .      Factoring (Sum and Product Method)   We want to take an expression like , and rewrite it as . The question is: how to choose the two numbers to put in the brackets. To do this, let's observe the pattern for how expansions work. Consider the expansion of ,   Here are some other expansions,   Observe how expanding the left side leads to the right side. On the right side, there are always 3 terms: , an term, and a constant number term. Also, to get the coefficient of the middle term, you add the two numbers in the brackets. To get the last constant term, you multiply those two numbers. In other words,    In general, if we multiply two factors together, say and , we get,     The first term is always .  The coefficient of the middle term is the sum of and .  The last term is the product of and .    In summary,   This leads to a general rule for factoring an expression of the form .    Factor .    Factor .   In summary,    Arrange the trinomial in descending power order (if needed)  Go through the pairs of number which multiply to , and check if they add to .  If they do, then write it as     Factor each quadratic expression.                                 Some additional helpful observations,    When the constant term is positive, then the factors of must be either both positive or both negative. If the middle term is positive, then both must be positive. If the middle term is negative, then both must be negative.  E.g. (last term is positive, middle term is positive, so both factors are positive)  E.g. (last term is positive, middle term is negative, so both factors are negative)      When the constant term is negative, then the factors of must have opposite signs (one positive, one negative). The sign of the larger number will be the sign of the coefficient of the middle term.  E.g. (last term is negative, so signs are opposite, and middle term is negative, so and 3 is negative)  E.g. (last term is negative, so signs are opposite, and middle term is positive, so and the 5 is positive)        Factoring Trinomials with Common Factors  Sometimes the trinomial is set up so that (the number in front of is not 1), however, there is a common factor that can be factored out, reducing the expression to one which can be factored using the previous method.   Factor each quadratic expression.                  Factoring Polynomials of the form ,  There are many methods for factoring these kinds of polynomials. All of them end up with the same result, but some are more efficient than others. I personally believe the cross method is the most efficient and easiest method to use.    Cross Method   Consider, To do the cross method, find two things that multiply to the first term, and two things that multiply to the last term. Then, draw a crisscross or X shape. Multiply the diagonals and add them up. The combination is correct if the diagonals add up to the middle term.     However, the diagonals add up to , which isn't the middle term. Instead, switch the 3 and the 1,     We now get , which is the middle term. After you've found the correct combination, the two factors can be read horizontally,        The cross method can be used even in the previous simpler case when . In other words, the cross method is a generalization of the sum and product method that we used when . For example, for, We could think of factors of that add up to , which are and , to get,   However, we can also use the cross method. The first term is , so we can write and on the left side, and the last term is , so we can write and on the right side. Then, we draw a crisscross or X shape, multiply the diagonals, and add them up. The combination is correct if the diagonals add up to the middle term.       This gives the same result as before.   At first, you will have to guess and check each combination until you get the correct one. With some practice, you will become better at guessing what the factors are, without having to go through every possible combination.   Consider, In this case, which is negative, unlike the previous examples. Technically, you can proceed as usual, finding two things that multiply to and , for example,     However, it turns out that the negative on the left side makes things more complicated, because then you have to worry about where to put the negative on the left side, as well as if the right side is 3 and 1 or and . There are a lot of negative signs. Instead, factor out from all terms first, which flips the sign of all the terms,   Then, factor the expression inside the brackets as before. Now, the only sign choice is the , where one of the factors must be negative.         Factor each expression fully.                         Factor each expression fully.                         Factor each expression fully.                          Factoring Out the GCF First Before the Cross Method   Consider the quadratic,   Here, the numbers are kinda large, but we can still use the cross method. After some trial and error, the correct combination is,      However, notice that also contains a common factor of 3, so we should factor it out.   Instead, it is easier to first factor out the common factor of 3,   Then, factoring the remaining only uses the sum and product method, and has smaller numbers to work with,     In general, it is easier to first factor out the GCF (greatest common factor), if there is one, before using the cross method. This makes the numbers you have to work with smaller, making it easier to find the factors.    Summary of Factoring    Always start by factoring out any common factor (the GCF)   If the leading coefficient is negative, factor out from all terms.     If ( ), then find two numbers that multiply to and add to .  If ( ), then use the cross method.    To check your answer, you can expand (FOIL) and check if you get back the original expression.     "

  "body": " Factoring and Roots of Polynomial Functions   Recall that our goal is to be able to factor polynomials, in a similar way that we can factor quadratic functions. The question is: how do we find factors?   Recall that quadratics can be written in factored form. For example,      The factors are and .    The zeros are and .     Notice that each zero corresponds to a factor. In other words,    This relationship extends to any polynomial function, and is called the factor theorem .    Factor Theorem   Factor theorem   Let be a polynomial. Then, is a factor of the polynomial if and only if . In other words,   If , then is a factor of .    If is a factor of , then .       This provides an equivalence between being a factor of , and being a root of . We also know that being a factor of means that dividing by gives a remainder of 0. Putting it together, these are all equivalent:    For the polynomial function , to determine if is a factor, evaluate ,   This means that is a root, so by the factor theorem, is a factor of .      For each zero of a polynomial function , give the corresponding factor.                      For , determine if each binomial is a factor.     No.     Yes.      For , determine if each binomial is a factor.     Yes.     No.      Find so that is a factor of .           What are all values of for which is a zero of ?

The Remainder Theorem  The remainder theorem states that when a polynomial is divided by a binomial , the remainder is .   Remainder theorem   If a polynomial is divided by a binomial , the remainder is equal to the function evaluated at , i.e. .     In other words, to find the remainder after division by , you can just evaluate the polynomial at , instead of going through the division process.

  "body": " Interval Notation   In mathematics, we often work with ranges of numbers. A interval is a range of numbers between two points.  Mathematicians developed a notation to write intervals of numbers concisely and clearly. An interval is made up of:   Two numbers , that represent the start and end of the interval.  Round brackets or square brackets , that indicate if the numbers at the start or end are included or not.    For example,   means all numbers between 3 and 7, including both 3 and 7.     means all numbers between 3 and 7, but not including 3 nor 7.       The type of bracket tells you if the endpoint is included or not:   Square brackets indicate the endpoint is included.  Round brackets (or parentheses ) indicate the endpoint is not included (i.e. is excluded ).    For example,   means all the numbers from to 4, including but not including 4.     means all the numbers from to 4, not including but including 4.       Some intervals have no maximum value, no minimum value, or both. For an interval which has no endpoint, we say that it extends to infinity, and use as the endpoint. We use round brackets for or , since is not a real number, so they are not numbers we can include or reach in our interval.   For example,   For all the numbers greater than 4, not including 4 , we write .     For all the numbers less than or equal to 5 , we write .     For all numbers , we write .         Summary of Interval Notation  In summary,            (the entire real line)    In short, an interval is a shorthand notation for describing all numbers between two endpoints.   Put the smaller number first, and the bigger number second.  Use square brackets when the endpoint is included.  Use round brackets when the endpoint is not included, including for or .   Note that the notation for an interval is the same as a point in the -plane . This is an overloading of notation, however in most cases, the context should make clear which one it's referring to.   "

  "title": "Radian Measure",
  "body": " Radian Measure   There is another unit for measuring angles, called a radian , which turns out to be more useful than degrees to use in calculus. First, it is helpful to step back and understand the idea of how angles can be measured.    Alternate Angular Units  Degrees are a unit such that 360 degrees make a full rotation. This makes sense for practical applications, and historically, for navigation, architecture, and astronomy. This is because you can divide 360 evenly into many numbers. However, if we were starting from scratch, we could also consider alternate useful units of measuring angles. For example:    The gradian , where a quarter rotation is defined to be 100 gradians. Then, a full rotation would be 400 gradians.  Or, 1 turn could be defined as a full rotation. Then, a half rotation is turns, or a quarter rotation is turns.  For units inspired by the fact that there are 8 slices in a pizza, a unit could be called a slice , defined to be th of a full rotation. Then, 8 slices would be a full rotation.  We could define 1 unit to be a quarter rotation. Then, 4 units is a full rotation.    Notice that ultimately, units are a convention, and what units are useful or most natural depends on the context.    Motivation for Radians  There is another unit of angle measure, called a radian . The idea is that we will measure angles based on how long the arc of the angle is.       The longer the arc is, the bigger the angle that is swept out. The amount you rotate is proportional to how far you travel along the circle.    Small rotation small distance traveled  Big rotation big distance traveled         However, just measuring the arc doesn't fully work, because the arc length depends on the size of the circle (basically, it depends on it's radius).    If you have a small circle, you won't have to walk very far to make a full loop.  If you have a big circle, the same angle will mean you walk a lot farther.         We want a measurement which purely measures rotation, that isn't affected by how big the circle is. The key idea is: even though the arc length changes when the circle gets bigger or smaller, it changes in a very predictable way. In particular, arc length is proportional to the radius.    If you double the radius, the arc length doubles .  If you triple the radius, the arc length triples .      For example, for this particular angle below, for cm, the arc is 8 cm, and for cm, the arc is 16 cm.       While the arc lengths are different, in both scenarios, the arc length is 2 radius lengths.    To measure arc length, instead of using meters or centimeters or any other unit of length, we use the radius itself as the unit. In other words, we ask:   For example:    If the radius is 4 m, and the arc length is 12 m, that is radius lengths of rotation.  If the radius is 3 m, and the arc length is 15 m, that is radius lengths of rotation.         In other words, to measure the angle, divide the arc length by the radius length.    Radians    One radian is defined to be the angle at the center of a circle such that the arc length associated with it is equal to the radius of the circle,       More generally, an angle with associated radius and arc length is given by,     The symbol for radians is rad , however the symbol is often omitted. So, if an angle has no unit, it should be assumed to be radians (and for degrees, use ).        In fancy math language, you can say that the angle  subtends the arc, or the arc is subtended by the angle .  Radians are technically ``dimensionless\", because they are the ratio of two lengths.      Converting Between Degrees and Radians  Degrees and radians are both units of angles, so we can convert between them. To find an equivalence between the two, first recall that corresponds to a full rotation. In radians, for a full rotation, its arc length is simply the circumference of the circle, which is given by . Then, . Therefore, a full rotation is radians. This implies that,   To be a bit more simple, we can divide both sides by 2, since it is a common factor, to get,   This is a conversion factor which allows us to convert between these two angle units, analogous to how 1 inch = 2.54 cm, or how 1 hour = 60 minutes.   Converting between degrees and radians        The ratio can be thought of as a conversion factor, a ratio used to convert between units.    Convert to degrees.      Sketching Radian Angles in Standard Position  To graph an angle in radians, it's easiest to think in terms of fractions of . To start,    is a full rotation ( )  is a half rotation ( )         Then,    (or half of ) is a quarter rotation (half of a half rotation), which is  (or a quarter of ) is half of a quarter rotation, which is .  is split into 6 equal pieces, which is .         For bigger angles, we can count multiples.    For example, for , first divide into 6 equal pieces, and then count 5 of them,           Special Angles in Radians    "

  "body": " Intro to Proving Trigonometric Identities    General Principles for Proving Identities      Convert all trigonometric expressions to sine and cosine . All trigonometric ratios can be written in terms of the ``basic\" trig ratios sine and cosine.   The one exception is if the entire identity only includes tangent and\/or cotangent, in which case it is usually simpler to convert everything in terms of tangent.     Start by manipulating the more complicated side . This is because is generally easier to go from something complex and simplify it, rather than go from something simple and make it more complex. In general,    Tangent is more complicated than sine and cosine  Reciprocal trigonometric functions are more complicated than primary trigonometric functions  Multiple fractions are easier to combine into one fraction, than writing one fraction as a combination of multiple fractions       Begin with the end in mind . Look at the form of the desired side before you start, and guide your work toward that structure.    Combine fractions using a common denominator.    Multiply by the conjugate, in order to use the Pythagorean identity.    Simplify complex fractions, by clearing denominators (multiply the numerator and denominator by the LCD).    Utilize algebraic identities, e.g. difference of squares, square of a sum, etc.     Use all trigonometric identities available to you.       Examples    Prove each trigonometric identity.     .    cancel.      .    simplify complex fraction, factor and cancel.      .    simplify complex fraction, factor and cancel.      .
