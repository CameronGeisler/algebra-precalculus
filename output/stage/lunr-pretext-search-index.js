  "title": "Factoring Quadratic Trinomials",
  "body": " Factoring Quadratic Trinomials   Factoring quadratic trinomials is arguably the single most used skill in high-school mathematics, being used in uncountably many high-school (and college) math problems. In this way, it is very important to master. However, unfortunately, it is among the least important and least useful topic \"in the real world\".  The goal is to factor any expression of the form , where are any integers.    First, we'll start with a simpler case, when .  Then, we'll consider the more difficult case, when .      Factoring (Sum and Product Method)   We want to take an expression like , and rewrite it as . The question is: how to choose the two numbers to put in the brackets. To do this, let's observe the pattern for how expansions work. Consider the expansion of ,   Here are some other expansions,   Observe how expanding the left side leads to the right side. On the right side, there are always 3 terms: , an term, and a constant number term. Also, to get the coefficient of the middle term, you add the two numbers in the brackets. To get the last constant term, you multiply those two numbers. In other words,    In general, if we multiply two factors together, say and , we get,     The first term is always .  The coefficient of the middle term is the sum of and .  The last term is the product of and .    In summary,   This leads to a general rule for factoring an expression of the form .    Factor .    Factor .   In summary,    Arrange the trinomial in descending power order (if needed)  Go through the pairs of number which multiply to , and check if they add to .  If they do, then write it as     Factor each quadratic expression.                                 Some additional helpful observations,    When the constant term is positive, then the factors of must be either both positive or both negative. If the middle term is positive, then both must be positive. If the middle term is negative, then both must be negative.  E.g. (last term is positive, middle term is positive, so both factors are positive)  E.g. (last term is positive, middle term is negative, so both factors are negative)      When the constant term is negative, then the factors of must have opposite signs (one positive, one negative). The sign of the larger number will be the sign of the coefficient of the middle term.  E.g. (last term is negative, so signs are opposite, and middle term is negative, so and 3 is negative)  E.g. (last term is negative, so signs are opposite, and middle term is positive, so and the 5 is positive)        Factoring Trinomials with Common Factors  Sometimes the trinomial is set up so that (the number in front of is not 1), however, there is a common factor that can be factored out, reducing the expression to one which can be factored using the previous method.   Factor each quadratic expression.                  Factoring Polynomials of the form ,  There are many methods for factoring these kinds of polynomials. All of them end up with the same result, but some are more efficient than others. I personally believe the cross method is the most efficient and easiest method to use.    Cross Method   Consider, To do the cross method, find two things that multiply to the first term, and two things that multiply to the last term. Then, draw a crisscross or X shape. Multiply the diagonals and add them up. The combination is correct if the diagonals add up to the middle term.     However, the diagonals add up to , which isn't the middle term. Instead, switch the 3 and the 1,     We now get , which is the middle term. After you've found the correct combination, the two factors can be read horizontally,        The cross method can be used even in the previous simpler case when . In other words, the cross method is a generalization of the sum and product method that we used when . For example, for, We could think of factors of that add up to , which are and , to get,   However, we can also use the cross method. The first term is , so we can write and on the left side, and the last term is , so we can write and on the right side. Then, we draw a crisscross or X shape, multiply the diagonals, and add them up. The combination is correct if the diagonals add up to the middle term.       This gives the same result as before.   At first, you will have to guess and check each combination until you get the correct one. With some practice, you will become better at guessing what the factors are, without having to go through every possible combination.   Consider, In this case, which is negative, unlike the previous examples. Technically, you can proceed as usual, finding two things that multiply to and , for example,     However, it turns out that the negative on the left side makes things more complicated, because then you have to worry about where to put the negative on the left side, as well as if the right side is 3 and 1 or and . There are a lot of negative signs. Instead, factor out from all terms first, which flips the sign of all the terms,   Then, factor the expression inside the brackets as before. Now, the only sign choice is the , where one of the factors must be negative.         Factor each expression fully.                         Factor each expression fully.                         Factor each expression fully.                          Factoring Out the GCF First Before the Cross Method   Consider the quadratic,   Here, the numbers are kinda large, but we can still use the cross method. After some trial and error, the correct combination is,      However, notice that also contains a common factor of 3, so we should factor it out.   Instead, it is easier to first factor out the common factor of 3,   Then, factoring the remaining only uses the sum and product method, and has smaller numbers to work with,     In general, it is easier to first factor out the GCF (greatest common factor), if there is one, before using the cross method. This makes the numbers you have to work with smaller, making it easier to find the factors.    Summary of Factoring    Always start by factoring out any common factor (the GCF)   If the leading coefficient is negative, factor out from all terms.     If ( ), then find two numbers that multiply to and add to .  If ( ), then use the cross method.    To check your answer, you can expand (FOIL) and check if you get back the original expression.     "

  "body": " Polynomial Functions Intro   Recall that previously, we considered constant functions, linear functions, and quadratic functions,   , whose graph is a horizontal line.  , whose graph is a (diagonal) line.  , whose graph is a parabola.   It turns out that we can also consider functions that are made up of higher powers of , like , and so on.    Power Functions    Consider , , , , , , etc. Observe that the function with even integer powers have a ``U-shape\" whereas the odd integer powers have an ``S-shape\".  Consider , , , , . These are a reflection over the -axis of the previous graphs.  Then, consider adding terms of lower degree. Observe that the rough of the graph is determined by the highest power of (called the degree of the polynomial).  Consider and , , . The rough shape of the graph is determined by the sign of the number in front of the highest power of (called the leading coefficient).      Polynomial Functions  Basically, a polynomial function is a function made of up powers of , combined with numbers through multiplication, addition, and subtraction. Sometimes, we refer to them simply as polynomials.   Polynomial Function  A polynomial function is a function of the form,   where are numbers, and . The coefficients of a polynomial function, are given using subscripted letters. In general, represents the coefficient of the term .   The degree of a polynomial function is the exponent on its highest power of . Here, this is a polynomial of degree .  The term with the highest power of , , is called the leading term , and its coefficient is called the leading coefficient .     A constant function is a polynomial function of degree 0.  A linear function, (where ), is a polynomial function of degree 1.  A quadratic function (where ), is a polynomial function of degree 2.   Roughly, the higher the degree, the more complicated the polynomial is.  The domain of a polynomial is all real numbers, or , because it only requires addition, subtraction, and multiplication of numbers, and these operations are always defined.   Example  The expression is a polynomial of degree 3.    Example  The expression is not a polynomial, as is not a non-negative integer.   Polynomials of degree 3 are sometimes called \\textbf{cubic}, degree 4 is \\textbf{quartic}, degree 5 is \\textbf{quintic}, and degree 6 is \\textbf{sextic} or \\textbf{hexic}.    Graph of a Polynomial Function  The graph of a polynomial function is both \\textbf{smooth} (in that it contains no sharp corners) and \\textbf{continuous} (it has no ``breaks\" and can be drawn without lifting your pencil off the page).  A polynomial has possibly multiple points where it turns around, going from increasing to decreasing, or vice versa. It turns out that a polynomial of degree has at most turning points.    End Behavior of Polynomial Functions  As we've seen, sometimes polynomial functions go right and up, and sometimes they go right and down, and sometimes left and up and other times left and down. Whether a polynomial goes up or down on the right or left is what we call its \\textit{end behavior}.   End Behavior  The \\textbf{end behavior} of a function is its behavior as becomes large in either the positive or negative direction. In other words, as , or the magnitude of , becomes large.   Graphically, end behavior is the behavior to the ``far right\" or ``far left\" side of the graph. The graph of a polynomial function may increase and decrease on different intervals, however it will ``eventually\" tend towards some behavior.  To describe end behavior, we often use a notation called \\textbf{arrow notation},   can be read as ``$x$ goes to infinity\".  is ``$x$ goes to negative infinity\".    If the polynomial increases without bound (goes up and up), we write .  If decreases without bound (goes down and down), we write .   Observe that the end behavior of a polynomial function is determined by the leading term. This is intuitively because when is large (either large positive or large negative), the leading term dominates the other terms, in the sense that it's size is much larger than the others, to where the others are insignificant.  This can be summarized in the \\textit{leading coefficient test}.   Leading coefficient test     For an odd function, the sign of the leading coefficient determines the overall trend, when it overall has ``positive\" or ``negative\" slope. Odd-degree polynomial functions have graphs with opposite end behavior at each end.  For an even function, the sign of the leading coefficient determines whether it ``opens up\" or ``opens down\". Even-degree polynomial functions have graphs with the same end behavior at each end.     y-Intercept of a Polynomial Function  Recall that the -intercept for linear and quadratic functions is simply the constant term,   More generally, the -intercept of a polynomial function is , the constant term, because .   Example  For , the -intercept is .     x-Intercepts of a Polynomial Function  The -intercept(s) of a polynomial function are the solutions to the equation .   Zero (Root) of a Function  A number is a \\textbf{zero} or (\\textbf{root}) of if .   The number is a zero if and only if is an -intercept of the graph of .    We will explore various techniques in order to solve an equation like this. In general, solving this equation by hand and exactly is very difficult, and sometimes impossible.    Remark  Technically, the zero polynomial is said to have degree , not 0 (for technical reasons that will become clear later).    Degree of a Product of Polynomials   Degree of a Product  The degree of a product of polynomials is the sum of the degrees. In particular, the product of linear factors is a polynomial of degree .

  "title": "Radian Measure",
  "body": " Radian Measure   There is another unit for measuring angles, called a radian , which turns out to be more useful than degrees to use in calculus. First, it is helpful to step back and understand the idea of how angles can be measured.    Alternate Angular Units  Degrees are a unit such that 360 degrees make a full rotation. This makes sense for practical applications, and historically, for navigation, architecture, and astronomy. This is because you can divide 360 evenly into many numbers. However, if we were starting from scratch, we could also consider alternate useful units of measuring angles. For example:    The gradian , where a quarter rotation is defined to be 100 gradians. Then, a full rotation would be 400 gradians.  Or, 1 turn could be defined as a full rotation. Then, a half rotation is turns, or a quarter rotation is turns.  For units inspired by the fact that there are 8 slices in a pizza, a unit could be called a slice , defined to be th of a full rotation. Then, 8 slices would be a full rotation.  We could define 1 unit to be a quarter rotation. Then, 4 units is a full rotation.    Notice that ultimately, units are a convention, and what units are useful or most natural depends on the context.    Motivation for Radians  There is another unit of angle measure, called a radian . The idea is that we will measure angles based on how long the arc of the angle is.       The longer the arc is, the bigger the angle that is swept out. The amount you rotate is proportional to how far you travel along the circle.    Small rotation small distance traveled  Big rotation big distance traveled         However, just measuring the arc doesn't fully work, because the arc length depends on the size of the circle (basically, it depends on it's radius).    If you have a small circle, you won't have to walk very far to make a full loop.  If you have a big circle, the same angle will mean you walk a lot farther.         We want a measurement which purely measures rotation, that isn't affected by how big the circle is. The key idea is: even though the arc length changes when the circle gets bigger or smaller, it changes in a very predictable way. In particular, arc length is proportional to the radius.    If you double the radius, the arc length doubles .  If you triple the radius, the arc length triples .      For example, for this particular angle below, for cm, the arc is 8 cm, and for cm, the arc is 16 cm.       While the arc lengths are different, in both scenarios, the arc length is 2 radius lengths.    To measure arc length, instead of using meters or centimeters or any other unit of length, we use the radius itself as the unit. In other words, we ask:   For example:    If the radius is 4 m, and the arc length is 12 m, that is radius lengths of rotation.  If the radius is 3 m, and the arc length is 15 m, that is radius lengths of rotation.         In other words, to measure the angle, divide the arc length by the radius length.    Radians    One radian is defined to be the angle at the center of a circle such that the arc length associated with it is equal to the radius of the circle,       More generally, an angle with associated radius and arc length is given by,     The symbol for radians is rad , however the symbol is often omitted. So, if an angle has no unit, it should be assumed to be radians (and for degrees, use ).        In fancy math language, you can say that the angle  subtends the arc, or the arc is subtended by the angle .  Radians are technically ``dimensionless\", because they are the ratio of two lengths.      Converting Between Degrees and Radians  Degrees and radians are both units of angles, so we can convert between them. To find an equivalence between the two, first recall that corresponds to a full rotation. In radians, for a full rotation, its arc length is simply the circumference of the circle, which is given by . Then, . Therefore, a full rotation is radians. This implies that,   To be a bit more simple, we can divide both sides by 2, since it is a common factor, to get,   This is a conversion factor which allows us to convert between these two angle units, analogous to how 1 inch = 2.54 cm, or how 1 hour = 60 minutes.   Converting between degrees and radians        The ratio can be thought of as a conversion factor, a ratio used to convert between units.    Convert to degrees.      Sketching Radian Angles in Standard Position  To graph an angle in radians, it's easiest to think in terms of fractions of . To start,    is a full rotation ( )  is a half rotation ( )         Then,    (or half of ) is a quarter rotation (half of a half rotation), which is  (or a quarter of ) is half of a quarter rotation, which is .  is split into 6 equal pieces, which is .         For bigger angles, we can count multiples.    For example, for , first divide into 6 equal pieces, and then count 5 of them,           Special Angles in Radians    "
