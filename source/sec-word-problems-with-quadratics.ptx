    <title>Maximize Product with Fixed Sum</title>
    
    <example>
      <title>Finding Two Numbers</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the two numbers whose sum is 20 that produce the greatest possible product.
        </p>
        <p>
          Intuitively, if two numbers have to add up to 20, then for example, if one of the numbers is 5, the other must be 15. If one is 8, then the other must be 12. In general, to get the 2nd number, take 20 minus the 1st number. We want to know which 2 numbers to pick so that their product (multiplying them together) is as big as possible. For example, let's try guessing and testing,
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>1 and 19 <m>\rightarrow</m> product of 19</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>5 and 15 <m>\rightarrow</m> product of 75 (bigger)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>8 and 12 <m>\rightarrow</m> product of 96 (even bigger)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>10 and 10 <m>\rightarrow</m> product of 100</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If you choose the 1st number to be bigger, it repeats the same pattern. For example, 12 and 8 is the same as 8 and 12.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It seems like 10 and 10 gives the biggest product, but we can show this using algebra.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Let <m>x</m> be the 1st number. Then, <m>20-x</m> is the 2nd number, because they both must add up to 20. Their product (say, <m>P</m>) is,
        </p>
        <md>
          <mrow>P = x(20-x)</mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
          We want the maximum of this function, which is its vertex. There are 2 approaches to find its vertex.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>It's already in factored form, so its zeros are <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=20</m>. Therefore, its vertex is halfway between them at <m>x=10</m>. Then, the 1st number should be 10 in order to maximize the product. Then, the 2nd number is also 10. The maximum product is <m>10 \cdot 10 = 100</m>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Expand,</p>
            <md>
              <mrow>P \amp = 20x-x^2</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = -x^2+20x</mrow>
            </md>
            <p>The vertex is at <m>x=-\frac{b}{2a}</m>, so,</p>
            <md>
              <mrow>x \amp = -\frac{20}{2(-1)} = 10</mrow>
            </md>
            <p>so the 1st number is 10, the 2nd number is 10, and the maximum product is 100.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </statement>
    </example>
    
    <exercise>
      <title>Sum of 16</title>
      <statement>
        <p>The sum of two numbers is 16. Find the largest possible product between these numbers.</p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>Let the numbers be <m>x</m> and <m>16-x</m>, so <m>P(x)=x(16-x)</m>.</p>
      </hint>
      <answer>
        <p>The largest product is <m>64</m>, obtained when the numbers are <m>8</m> and <m>8</m>.</p>
      </answer>
    </exercise>
    
    <exercise>
      <title>Sum of 29</title>
      <statement>
        <p>Two numbers have a sum of 29 and a product that is a maximum. Determine the two numbers and the maximum product.</p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>If the numbers are <m>x</m> and <m>29-x</m>, then <m>P=x(29-x)</m>.</p>
      </hint>
      <answer>
        <p>14.5 and 14.5, and the maximum product is <m>\frac{841}{4}=210.25</m>.</p>
      </answer>
    </exercise>
    
    <p>
      In turns out that in general, if two numbers have a fixed sum, then their product will be largest when both numbers are exactly half of the sum. In other words, if the sum is <m>S</m>, then both numbers should be <m>\frac{S}{2}</m>.

      <hint>
        <p>One lap is 500 m, so <m>2L+\pi W=500</m>, and the rectangular infield area is <m>A=LW</m>.</p>
      </hint>
      <answer>
        <p>Yes. With <m>2L+\pi W=500</m>, the infield area is <m>A(W)=W\left(\frac{500-\pi W}{2}\right)=250W-\frac{\pi}{2}W^2</m>, which is maximized at <m>W=\frac{250}{\pi}</m> and <m>L=125</m>. So the largest rectangular infield is <m>125</m> m by <m>\frac{250}{\pi}</m> m, with maximum area <m>\frac{31250}{\pi}\text{ m}^2</m>.</p>
