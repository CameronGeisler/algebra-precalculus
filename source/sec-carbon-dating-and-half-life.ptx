  <title>Carbon Dating and Half-Life</title>
  
  <!-- <introduction>
    <p>
      <term>Carbon dating</term> is a method for estimating how long ago a living thing died. Using it, we can estimate how long ago animals like mammoths lived, or ancient humans, without having actual records of them.
    </p>
    
    <example>
      <p>
        All living things contain carbon, and there are different types of carbon.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>One is called <term>carbon-12</term>, which is the <q>normal</q> type of carbon.</p></li>
        <li><p>Another is <term>carbon-14</term>, which is a radioactive type of carbon (called an isotope), which decays over time into a different element.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When a plant or animal is alive, it always has roughly the same amount of carbon-14. However, when it dies, it stops taking in new carbon-14 (or any carbon at all). Over time, its amount of carbon-14 decreases. It turns out that it decreases exponentially.
      </p>
      <p>
        To measure the rate of exponential decay, instead of using a percentage, we use its <term>half-life</term>, which is the time it takes for the amount to decay to <em>half</em> its initial amount.
      </p>
      <p>
        Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5730 years. This means that after 5730 years, half of the carbon-14 is gone. After another 5730 years, half of what's left is gone (so 25% of the initial amount is left). Then half again, and again, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means the percent of carbon-14 remaining after <m>t</m> years is given by,
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>P(t) = 100 \brac{\frac{1}{2}}^{\frac{t}{5730}}</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        where our initial amount is 100%.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea behind carbon dating is that if we measure how much carbon-14 the dead organism has, and also know how much it had when alive, we can estimate how long the carbon-14 has been decaying for, and therefore how long ago it died.
      </p>
    </example>
    
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5730 years. Find the approximate age of a dead organism that has 20% of its original carbon-14 in its tissues.

      <answer><p>Approximately 13308 years</p></answer>
    </exercise>
    
    <remark>
      <p>
        Carbon dating works for organisms that are up to about 60000 years old, as anything older than that has too little carbon-14 to measure. It was developed in 1949 by <alert>Willard Libby</alert> (1908-1980), American chemist, and it revolutionized archaeology and paleontology.

    <p>
      Many elements have radioactive <em>isotopes</em>, which are versions of the element which are radioactive. These radioactive isotopes decay over time into regular, non-radioactive elements. They decay continuously at a constant percentage, and so they can be modelled using exponential decay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <term>half-life</term> of a substance is the time required for a decaying amount to decay to half its initial amount.
    </p>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Half-life is analogous to <em>doubling time</em> for exponential growth.
