  <subsection>
    <title>Multiplicity of Roots (Order)</title>
    <p>
      Some polynomial functions have roots which are repeated.
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>Quadratic with a Double Root</title>
      <p>
        Recall that for quadratic polynomials, sometimes, after factoring, the two factors are the same. For example,
        <md>
          <mrow>f(x) \amp = x^2 - 6x + 9</mrow>
          <mrow>     \amp = (x-3)(x-3)</mrow>
          <mrow>     \amp = (x - 3)^2</mrow>
        </md>
        Then, <m>x = 3</m> is said to be a <em>double root</em>. At this root, the graph doesn't  cross the <m>x</m>-axis, but instead just touches it and turns around (<url href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/xqdmumubyx">Graph of <m>y = (x-3)^2</m></url>).
      </p>
    </example>
    <p>
      More generally, a polynomial function can have a double root, triple root, etc.
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>Polynomial Graphs with Repeated Roots</title>
      <p>
        Consider these polynomials: <url href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/khhzdh3kqx">Polynomial graphs with repeated roots</url>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>y = (x + 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)</m>. This has zeros at <m>-1</m>, 2, and 3. All of the other functions will have the same zeros as well.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>y = (x + 1)^2(x - 2)(x - 3)</m>. This has a power of 2 on the <m>x+1</m>, but all of the <m>x</m>-intercepts are the same. What is different about the graph at <m>x = -1</m>?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>y = (x + 1)^2(x - 2)^2(x - 3)</m>. Here, there is a power of 2 on <m>x =-1</m> and <m>x=2</m>. What is common to both these <m>x</m>-intercepts?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>y = (x + 1)^3(x - 2)(x - 3)</m>. What does the graph do when the power is 3?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>y = (x + 1)^4(x - 2)(x - 3)</m>. What does the graph do when the power is 4?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Try higher exponents on the factor <m>x+1</m>. You may need to zoom out or zoom in to see the behavior at <m>x = -1</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Observe that for each exponent (1, 2, 3, 4, ...), the graph behaves differently at the <m>x</m>-intercept.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In particular, for even exponents, the function touches and turns around. For odd exponents, the function flattens out and crosses.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </example>
    <p>
      The exponent associated with the root affects the graph at that <m>x</m>-intercept. We call this exponent the <em>multiplicity</em> of the root.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        A root <m>a</m> of a polynomial is of <term>multiplicity</term> <m>k</m> if the factor <m>x-a</m> is to the <m>k</m>th power in the factored form of the polynomial.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            In some textbooks, multiplicity is instead referred to as <term>order</term>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Intuitively, <q>multiplicity</q> comes from the word <q>multiple</q>, meaning <q>how many times something occurs</q>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Graphically,
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          For <alert>even</alert> multiplicity, the graph <em>touches</em> the <m>x</m>-axis and <em>turns around</em> (or <q>bounces</q>).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          For <alert>odd</alert> multiplicity, the graph <em>crosses</em> the <m>x</m>-axis. Further, for a zero of multiplicity greater than 1, the graph of <m>f</m> will <em>flatten out</em> near the zero.
        </p>
