  <title>Word Problems with Rational Equations</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Some word problem situations lead to a rational equation. There are 3 broad categories of problems:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Work problems.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Rate/speed problems.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Current/wind problems.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These are very standard categories, so make sure you master each one. Also, review <url href="https://camerongeisler.github.io/algebra-precalculus/sec-word-problem-solving-strategy.html" visual="Word Problem Solving Strategy">Word Problem Solving Strategy</url> for learning how to think about word problems broadly.

    <title>Work Problems (Combined Work Rate)</title>
    <p>
      Two people or machines work together at different rates to complete a task.
    </p>
    
    <example>
      <title>Alex and Brianna</title>
      <p>
        Alex can paint a wall in <m>4</m> hours. Brianna can paint the same wall in <m>6</m> hours. If they work together and do not stop, how long will it take them to paint the wall?
      </p>
      <p>
        We want to find the time it takes for Alex and Brianna to paint the wall together, so let <m>t</m> be the number of hours it takes them to paint the wall, working together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think about what happens as time passes. If Alex can finish <m>1</m> whole wall in <m>4</m> hours, then,
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>After <m>1</m> hour, he has finished <m>\frac{1}{4}</m> of the wall.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>After <m>2</m> hours, he's finished <m>\frac{2}{4}</m> of the wall.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>After <m>3</m> hours, he's finished <m>\frac{3}{4}</m>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In general, after <m>t</m> hours, he has finished the fraction <m>\frac{t}{4}</m> of the wall.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Similarly, Brianna can finish the wall in <m>6</m> hours, so,
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>After <m>1</m> hour, she's finished <m>\frac{1}{6}</m> of the wall.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>After <m>2</m> hours, she's finished <m>\frac{2}{6}</m>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>And in general, after <m>t</m> hours, she has finished <m>\frac{t}{6}</m> of the wall.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Working together, after <m>t</m> hours they have finished one whole wall, or 1 of the wall. Then,
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\begin{pmatrix} \text{fraction done} \\ \text{by Alex} \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} \text{fraction done} \\ \text{by Brianna} \end{pmatrix} = \underbrace{1}_{\text{entire job}}</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        Then,
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{t}{4} + \frac{t}{6} = 1</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        Then, to solve this equation, clear the denominators by multiplying both sides by 12 (the LCD),
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>12 \left(\frac{t}{4} + \frac{t}{6}\right) \amp = 12 \cdot 1</mrow>
        <mrow>3t + 2t \amp = 12</mrow>
        <mrow>5t \amp = 12 \amp\amp \text{collecting like terms}</mrow>
        <mrow>t \amp = \frac{12}{5} = 2.4 \amp\amp \text{dividing both sides by 5}</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        Therefore, together, they would take 2.4 hours. This is reasonable, because since they are working together, it will take somewhat less time than either of them working individually (4 hours or 6 hours).
      </p>
      <p>
        Another way to organize this information is in a table, with 3 columns: the time it takes, the fraction done in 1 hour, and the fraction done in <m>t</m> hours.
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\begin{array}{c|c|c|c} \amp \text{time} \amp \text{1 hour} \amp t \text{ hours} \\ \hline \text{Alex} \amp 4 \amp \frac{1}{4} \amp \frac{t}{4} \\ \hline \text{Brianna} \amp 6 \amp \frac{1}{6} \amp \frac{t}{6} \\ \hline \text{both} \amp t \amp \frac{1}{t} \amp 1 \\ \end{array}</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        Another equivalent way to do this is to add the contributions after 1 hour, which gives,
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{t}</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        This equation is equivalent to the previous equation, and so will also give the correct answer. However, I don't think it's as intuitive as the previous one.
      </p>
    </example>
    
    <p>
      In general,
    </p>
    <me>
      \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \text{fraction done} \\ \text{by A} \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} \text{fraction done} \\ \text{by B} \end{pmatrix} = \underbrace{1}_{\text{entire job}}}

    <title>Relative Speed Comparison Problems</title>
    
    <example>
      <title>Jess and Sarah</title>
      <p>
        Jess can run <m>3</m> miles per hour faster than her sister Sarah can walk. If Jess ran <m>12</m> miles in the same time it took Sarah to walk <m>8</m> miles, what is the speed of each sister?
      </p>
      <p>
        We want to find the speed of each sister, so we can let <m>x</m> be the speed of one sister, and then the other one differs by 3. Let <m>x</m> be Sarah's speed. Then, Jess's speed is 3 mi/h more, so it's <m>x+3</m> (Note that you could have instead let <m>x</m> be Jess's speed, and then Sarah would be <m>x-3</m>). We know they took the same amount of time, so,
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\begin{pmatrix} \text{Sarah's} \\ \text{time} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \text{Jess's} \\ \text{time} \end{pmatrix}</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        Then, remember how speed, distance, and time are related by <m>v = \frac{d}{t}</m> (or <m>d = vt</m>, or <m>t = \frac{d}{v}</m>). We'll use <m>t = \frac{d}{v}</m> here because we want time.
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{8}{x} \amp = \frac{12}{x+3}</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        To solve, clear denominators by multiplying by <m>x(x+3)</m> (the LCD),
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>8(x+3) \amp = 12x</mrow>
        <mrow>8x + 24 \amp = 12x</mrow>
        <mrow>4x \amp = 24</mrow>
        <mrow>x \amp = 6</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        Therefore, Sarah's speed is 6 mi/h, and Jess's speed is 3 mi/h faster, so it is 9 mi/h.
      </p>
    </example>
    
    <p>
      In general, remember that,
    </p>
    <md>
      <mrow>\boxed{v = \frac{d}{t} \qquad \text{or} \qquad d = vt \qquad \text{or} \qquad t = \frac{d}{v}} \qquad \begin{cases} d \rightarrow \text{distance} \\ t \rightarrow \text{time} \\ v \rightarrow \text{speed (or velocity)} \end{cases}</mrow>

    <title>Current/Wind Travel Problems</title>
    
    <example>
      <title>Kayaking</title>
      <p>
        You are kayaking on a river. You start paddling from a dock <m>8</m> km upstream to a campsite, then immediately turns around and paddles <m>8</m> km back downstream to the dock. The river’s current flows at <m>2</m> km/h. The total time for the trip is <m>3</m> hours. What is your paddling speed in still water?
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>v</m> be your speed in still water. Then, your speed upstream is <m>v-2</m>, because the 2 km/h current is pushing you backwards. Similarly, your speed downstream is <m>v+2</m>, because the 2 km/h current is helping you go faster. Then, the total time for the trip is 3 hours, so,
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\begin{pmatrix} \text{time} \\ \text{upsteam} \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} \text{time} \\ \text{downstream} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \text{total} \\ \text{time} \end{pmatrix}</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        Then, to calculate time, use <m>t = \frac{d}{v}</m>,
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{8}{v-2} + \frac{8}{v+2} = 3</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        To solve, multiply both sides by <m>(v-2)(v+2)</m> (the LCD),
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>8(v+2) + 8(v-2) \amp = 3(v-2)(v+2)</mrow>
        <mrow>8v + 16 + 8v - 16 \amp = 3(v^2 - 4)</mrow>
        <mrow>16v \amp = 3v^2 - 12</mrow>
        <mrow>0 \amp = 3v^2 - 16v - 12</mrow>
        <mrow>0 \amp = (2v+3)(v-6)</mrow>
        <mrow>v \amp = -\frac{3}{2}, 6</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        We keep only the positive solution, because paddling speed can't be negative. Therefore, your paddling speed in still water is 6 km/h.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you like, to help organize the information, you can also make a table, with the distance, rate, and time going upstream and downstream,
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\begin{array}{c|c|c|c} \amp d \amp r \amp t \\ \hline \text{upstream} \amp 8 \amp v-2 \amp \frac{8}{v-2} \\ \hline \text{downstream} \amp 8 \amp v+2 \amp \frac{8}{v+2} \end{array}</mrow>
