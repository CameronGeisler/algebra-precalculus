  <title>Intro to Exponential Growth and Decay</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Exponential functions can be used to model amounts that change over time.
    </p>
    
    <example>
      <title>Population Growth</title>
      <p>
        A small town has a population of 12000 people. Each year, the population increases by 10%.
      </p>
      <ol marker="(a)">
        <li>
          <p>What will be the population of the town after 1 year? 2 years? 3 years?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>What will be the population after <m>t</m> years?</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <q>Increase by 10%</q> means that it keeps all of the population it has, and adds 10% more of that number.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>100% of the population is the amount it already has</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>10% more means you are at 110% of the original.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As a decimal, <m>110\%=1.10</m>. So, increase by 10% means multiply by 1.10.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>At the start (year 0), the population is 12000.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>After 1 year, the population is <m>12000 \times 1.10 = 13200</m> people.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>After 2 years, the population is <m>12000 \times 1.10 \times 1.10 = 12000(1.10)^2 = 14520</m> people.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>After 3 years, the population is <m>12000 \times 1.10 \times 1.10 \times 1.10 = 12000(1.10)^3 = 15972</m> people.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Notice the pattern, which is that we multiply the initial population of 12000 by 1.10 for each year.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, after <m>t</m> years, we are multiplying by 1.10 precisely <m>t</m> times. So, the general formula for population, we'll call it <m>P(t)</m>, is given by,
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>P(t)=12000(1.10)^t</mrow>
      </md>
    </example>
    
    <example>
      <title>Smartphone Depreciation</title>
      <p>
        Suppose you buy a new smartphone for $1400. Each year, its value drops by 35%.
      </p>
      <ol marker="(a)">
        <li>
          <p>How much will it be worth after 1 year? 2 years? 3 years?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>How much will it be worth after <m>t</m> years?</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <q>Drop by 35%</q> means you keep 65% of the value each year, because you start with 100% of its value, take away 35%, and are left with 65%. As a decimal, <m>65\%=0.65</m>, so decreasing by 35% each year means multiply by 0.65 each year.

    <title>Compound Interest</title>
    <p>
      Another application of exponential growth is <term>compound interest</term>, where your interest also earns interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a bank pays interest, it adds some money to your account. If you leave that interest in the account, then the next time interest is calculated, it’s calculated on a bigger amount than before. So the amount grows faster over time because it’s not just the original money earning interest, but the added interest also starts earning interest. This is precisely exponential growth.
    </p>
    
    <example>
      <p>
        Suppose that you deposit $2500 and your account earns 4% per year. After 1 year, the bank will pay you,
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\$2500 \times 0.04 = \$100</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        This means that after 1 year, your new total is,
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{new amount} &amp; = \text{old amount} + \text{interest}</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp; = 2500 + 100</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp; = \$2600</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        Just like other examples of exponential growth, we can think of adding this interest like a growth factor. In this case, it is <m>1+0.04=1.04</m>, because to increase by 4% each year, we have to multiply by 1.04. Then, the amount of money <m>A</m> after <m>t</m> years is given by,
      </p>

      <title>Krumbein Phi Scale</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          The Krumbein phi scale is used in geology to classify sediments such as silt, sand, and gravel by particle size. The scale is modelled by the function <m>D(\varphi)=2^{-\varphi}</m>, where <m>D</m> is the diameter of the particle, in millimetres, and <m>\varphi</m> is the Krumbein scale value. Fine sand has a Krumbein scale value of approximately 3. Coarse gravel has a Krumbein scale value of approximately <m>-5</m>.
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement><p>Why would a coarse material have a negative scale value?</p></statement>
        <answer><p>Coarser material has a larger diameter <m>D</m>. Since <m>D(\varphi)=2^{-\varphi}</m>, making <m>\varphi</m> negative makes <m>-\varphi</m> positive, which increases <m>2^{-\varphi}</m> and therefore increases the diameter.</p></answer>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement><p>How does the diameter of fine sand compare to the diameter of coarse gravel?</p></statement>
        <answer><m>D(3)=2^{-3}=\frac{1}{8}</m> mm and <m>D(-5)=2^{-(-5)}=2^5=32</m> mm, so <m>\frac{D(-5)}{D(3)}=\frac{32}{\frac{1}{8}}=256</m>, meaning coarse gravel has a diameter 256 times the diameter of fine sand</answer>
