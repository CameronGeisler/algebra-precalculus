  <title>Quadratic Inequalities in One Variable</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In addition to quadratic equations, we can also consider quadratic inequalities, which are closely related.
    </p>

      <title>Motivational Example: Solving with a Graph</title>
      <p>
        Consider the inequality,
      </p>
      <me>x^2-4x+3 \gt 0</me>
      <p>
        The goal is to find all of the values of <m>x</m> such that <m>x^2 - 4x + 3 \gt 0</m>. In simple terms, this means all numbers <m>x</m>, where if you substitute it into <m>x^2-4x+3</m>, the result is positive. This is most intuitive by visualizing the graph of the quadratic function <m>y = x^2 - 4x + 3</m>,

          xlabel = \(x\),
          ylabel = \(y\),
          ymin = -2, ymax = 5,
          xmin = -1, xmax = 5,
          domain = -1:5,
          samples = 100,
          grid = major,
          enlargelimits=true,

      <p>
        Then, determining where <m>x^2-4x+3 \gt 0</m> is equivalent to determining the <m>x</m> where the <m>y</m>-coordinate of the parabola is positive. Observe that the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph are <m>x = 1, 3</m>. So, the graph is positive when <m>x \lt 1</m> or when <m>x \gt 3</m>. Therefore, the solution is <m>x \lt 1</m> or <m>x \gt 3</m>.

      <title>Motivation: sign analysis with roots</title>
      <p>
        Consider the inequality <m>x^2-x-6 \lt 0</m>. Like before, first, find the roots of the parabola, by making it an equals sign, and factoring,
      </p>
      <md>

        <mrow>(x-3)(x+2) \amp= 0</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        So, the roots are <m>x = 3</m> and <m>x = -2</m>. Since <m>x^2-x-6</m> has a positive leading coefficient (+1), the parabola opens up. This means that the quadratic roughly looks like this,

        From this, the parabola is negative when <m>x</m> is between <m>-2</m> and <m>3</m>, or <m>-2 \lt x \lt 3</m>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <p>
      To solve the inequality, we don't need to graph the entire parabola precisely. Instead, we only need to find the roots, and know the basic shape (opening up or down).
    </p>
    <p>
      A quadratic expression can only change sign at its roots. This means, if a quadratic has two roots, then:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>If the quadratic is positive in one interval, it will switch to negative when crossing a root.</p></li>
      <li><p>After crossing the second root, it switches back to positive.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If the quadratic opens down, then the pattern is reversed: it first is negative, then positive, then negative. The pattern of signs follows,

    <title>Solving Using Sign Chart and Test Points</title>
    <p>
      There is another method to solve a quadratic inequality, that is more systematic and general, but less efficient for quadratic inequalities, called the <term>sign chart method</term>, or <term>test point method</term>.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex-quad-ineq-test-points">
      <p>
        Consider the inequality <m>x^2 - 6x + 8 \gt 0</m>. Similar to before, first find the critical values, by factoring,
      </p>
      <md>

        <mrow>(x-2)(x-4) \amp= 0</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        So, the critical values are <m>x = 2</m> and <m>x = 4</m>. Set up a number line, with these roots marked,
      </p>
      <image width="50%">
        <latex-image>
          \begin{tikzpicture}[font=\small, baseline=(current bounding box.center)]
          % Draw a horizontal number line
          \draw[&lt;-&gt;, thick] (-3,0) -- (3,0);

          % Mark the points (evenly spaced, not to scale)
          \draw (-1,0.15) -- (-1,-0.15);
          \draw (1,0.15) -- (1,-0.15);

          % Label the points below the number line
          \node[below] at (-1,-0.15) {$2$};
          \node[below] at (1,-0.15) {$4$};
          \end{tikzpicture}
        </latex-image>
      </image>
      <p>
        These roots split up the number line into 3 intervals: <m>x \lt 2</m>, <m>2 \lt x \lt 4</m>, and <m>x \gt 4</m>. For each of these intervals, the quadratic will either be positive everywhere, or negative everywhere. So, it is enough to test a single point, and see if the quadratic is positive or negative. For example,
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>For <m>x \lt 2</m>, choose <m>x = 1</m>:</p>
          <me>(1 - 2)(1 - 4) = (-1)(-3) = 3 \gt 0 \quad \text{(positive)}</me>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>For <m>2 \lt x \lt 4</m>, choose <m>x = 3</m>:</p>
          <me>(3 - 2)(3 - 4) = (1)(-1) = -1 \lt 0 \quad \text{(negative)}</me>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>For <m>x \gt 4</m>, choose <m>x = 5</m>:</p>
          <me>(5 - 2)(5 - 4) = (3)(1) = 3 \gt 0 \quad \text{(positive)}</me>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To illustrate these results, we can put a <m>+</m> or <m>-</m> above each interval, depending if it's positive or negative.

        We use open circles (basically, hollow circles) to indicate that <m>x=2</m> and <m>x=4</m> are not included in the solution, because the inequality is <m>\lt</m>.

        In fact, when doing test points, we only need to know the sign of the output (whether it is positive or negative). Its exact value as a number isn't necessary. Recall that with multiplying positive and negative numbers,

        <li><p>Test <m>x = 5</m>: <m>(5 - 2)(5 - 4) = (+)(+) = +</m></p></li>
      </ul>
    </example>

    <ul>
      <li><p>The roots of the parabola are called <term>critical points</term>, because they are the important points that indicate where the parabola can change sign from positive to negative, or vice versa.</p></li>
      <li><p>The number line with labelled <m>+</m> and <m>-</m> intervals is called a <term>sign chart</term>, and this method is sometimes called the <term>test point method</term>.</p></li>

    <p>
      In summary, after finding the critical values,
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Choose a test point in each interval, and evaluate the quadratic function there to determine if it is positive or negative, i.e. if that interval is in the solution set.</p></li>

    <remark>
      <p>
        Some teachers require you to use a more elaborate table to do a sign chart. I personally believe this chart is excessively tedious and doesn't add much, but some teachers require it to properly show your work.

        We want where the expression is greater than or equal to zero, which is the positive parts, so it's when <m>x \leq -2</m> or when <m>x \geq 2</m>. We include the endpoints, because the inequality includes equals. Therefore, <m>x \leq -2</m> or <m>x \geq 2</m>.

      <title>Solve <m>9 - x^2 \geq 0</m></title>
      <p>
        The goal is to find all values of <m>x</m> such that <m>9 - x^2 \geq 0</m>. First, find the critical values by solving the corresponding equation,
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>9 - x^2 \amp= 0</mrow>
        <mrow>9 \amp= x^2</mrow>
        <mrow>x \amp= \pm 3</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        So, the critical values are <m>x = 3</m> and <m>x = -3</m>. These divide the number line into three intervals. Notice that the leading coefficient is negative (<m>-1</m>, from the <m>-x^2</m> term), so the parabola opens down. This means the sign pattern is <m>- \, + \, -</m>.
