  <title>Oblique Triangles Summary</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Here is a simple summary of how to solve (oblique) triangles.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short,
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you know an side-angle pair (side and it's opposite angle), use the <em>law of sines</em>.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, use the <em>law of cosines</em>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      More specifically, based on the information given:
    </p>
    <tabular halign="left">
      <row bottom="minor">
        <cell><alert>Type</alert></cell>
        <cell></cell>
        <cell><alert>First steps</alert></cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Two angles and non-included side</cell>
        <cell>AAS</cell>
        <cell>law of sines</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Two angles and included side</cell>
        <cell>ASA</cell>
        <cell>solve for remaining angle, then law of sines</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Two sides and opposite angle</cell>
        <cell>SSA</cell>
        <cell>law of sines</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Two sides and included angle</cell>
        <cell>SAS</cell>
        <cell>law of cosines (solve for side first)</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Three sides</cell>
        <cell>SSS</cell>
        <cell>law of cosines (solve for an angle first)</cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>
    <p>
      Some additional notes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you know 2 angles, you can solve for the 3rd (subtract 180 minus the other two angles).</li>
      <li>The SSA case also can be the ambiguous case if the triangle structure is unknown, with either 0, 1, or 2 solutions.</li>
      <li>Be careful with rounding in intermediate steps, because it can lead to bigger rounding error in future calculations. A good guideline is to round intermediate calculations to at least 1 more decimal place than what the final answer asks for.</li>
    </ul>
