    <title>Summary of Solving Oblique Triangles</title>

    <p>A good guideline is that for your first step, in short,</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>If you know a side-angle pair (side length and its opposite angle), use the <em>law of sines</em>.</p></li>
      <li><p>Otherwise, use the <em>law of cosines</em>.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>More precisely, here are the first steps to take based on what information you have,</p>

      <row header="yes" bottom="minor">
        <cell><alert>Type</alert></cell>
        <cell></cell>

      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Two angles and non-included side</cell>
        <cell>AAS</cell>
        <cell>law of sines</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Two angles and included side</cell>
        <cell>ASA</cell>
        <cell>solve for remaining angle, then law of sines</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Two sides and opposite angle</cell>
        <cell>SSA</cell>
        <cell>law of sines</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Two sides and included angle</cell>
        <cell>SAS</cell>
        <cell>law of cosines (solve for side first)</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Three sides</cell>
        <cell>SSS</cell>
        <cell>law of cosines (solve for an angle first)</cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>

    <p>Some additional notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Remember: If you know 2 angles, you can solve for the 3rd! Just subtract 180 minus the other two angles.</p></li>
      <li><p>If it is a <em>right</em> triangle, then remember that you can simply use SOH-CAH-TOA! No need to use law of sines or law of cosines.</p></li>
      <li><p>The SSA case also can be the ambiguous case if the triangle structure is unknown, with possibly 2, 1, or 0 solutions.</p></li>
      <li><p>Be careful with rounding in intermediate steps, because it can lead to bigger rounding error in future calculations. A good guideline is to round intermediate calculations to at least 1 more decimal place than what the final answer asks for. So, if the final answer should be rounded to 1 decimal place, keep at least 2 decimal places your calculations, until the end.</p></li>

    <title>Examples</title>

    <example xml:id="ex-oblique-summary-1">
      <p>Triangle <m>ABC</m> has <m>a = 8</m>, <m>b = 7</m>, and <m>A = 39°</m>. Find all missing sides and angles, rounding to one decimal place as needed.</p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="ex-oblique-summary-2">
      <p>A surveyor is mapping a plot of land. From their position, they determine it is 1200 feet to a post that marks the property border. The surveyor then turns by 72° to see an oak tree, which marks another corner of the property, that is 1800 feet away. What is the distance between the post and the oak tree? Hint: law of cosines.</p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="ex-oblique-summary-3">
      <p>Matt measures the angle of elevation of the peak of a mountain as <m>35°</m>. Susie, who is 1200 feet closer on a straight level path, measures the angle of elevation as <m>42°</m>. How high is the mountain?</p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="ex-oblique-summary-4">
      <p>A bicycle wheel has a radius of 35 cm. The wheel's spokes are evenly spaced so that each pair of adjacent spokes forms a <m>30°</m> angle at the center. Find the distance between two adjacent spokes where they meet the rim. Hint: law of sines (or law of cosines). Answer: 18.1 cm.</p>

      <p>A clock has an hour hand of length 12 cm and a minute hand of length 15 cm. Find the distance between the tips of the two hands when it is 4:00.
