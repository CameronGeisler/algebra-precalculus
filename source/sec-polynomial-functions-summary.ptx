    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <alert>End behavior</alert>. Find the end behavior of the polynomial, based on the degree and leading coefficient.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <alert>y-Intercept</alert>: Find the <m>y</m>-intercept, by evaluating <m>f(0)</m> (setting <m>x = 0</m> and solving for <m>y</m>).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <alert>x-Intercept(s)</alert>: Find any <m>x</m>-intercepts, by finding the zeros of the polynomial (setting <m>y = 0</m> and solving for <m>x</m>).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <alert>Multiplicity</alert>. Note the multiplicity of each zero. See <xref ref="multiplicity-table"/>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Plot the <m>x</m>-intercepts and <m>y</m>-intercept.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Plot additional points between zeros (for more detail, if necessary).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Connect all of the points with a smooth curve, while respecting the end behavior and multiplicity at each zero.
