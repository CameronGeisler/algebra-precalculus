  <title>Polynomial Functions Intro</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Recall that previously, we considered constant functions, linear functions, and quadratic functions,
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><m>f(x) = b</m>, whose graph is a horizontal line.</li>
      <li><m>f(x) = mx + b</m>, whose graph is a (diagonal) line.</li>
      <li><m>f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c</m>, whose graph is a parabola.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    It turns out that we can also consider functions that are made up of higher powers of <m>x</m>, like <m>x^3, x^4, x^5</m>, and so on.
    </p>
  </introduction>

<subsection xml:id="power-functions">
  <title>Power Functions</title>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Consider <m>y = x</m>, <m>y = x^2</m>, <m>y = x^3</m>, <m>y = x^4</m>, <m>y = x^5</m>, <m>y = x^6</m>, etc. Observe that the function with even integer powers have a ``U-shape" whereas the odd integer powers have an ``S-shape".
      </li>
      <li>
        Consider <m>y = -x</m>, <m>y = -x^2</m>, <m>y = -x^3</m>, <m>y = -x^4</m>, <m>y = -x^5</m>. These are a reflection over the <m>x</m>-axis of the previous graphs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then, consider adding terms of lower degree. Observe that the rough of the graph is determined by the highest power of <m>x</m> (called the degree of the polynomial).
      </li>
      <li>
        Consider <m>y = 3x + 1</m> and <m>y = -2x -1</m>, <m>y = 3x^3 - x^2 + 3</m>, <m>y = -4x^3 + x + 1</m>. The rough shape of the graph is determined by the sign of the number in front of the highest power of <m>x</m> (called the leading coefficient).
      </li>
    </ul>

<subsection xml:id="polynomial-functions">
  <title>Polynomial Functions</title>
  <p>
    Basically, a polynomial function is a function made of up powers of <m>x</m>, combined with numbers through multiplication, addition, and subtraction. Sometimes, we refer to them simply as polynomials.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <title>Polynomial Function</title>
    <p>
      A <em>polynomial function</em> is a function of the form,
      <me>
        f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \dots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      where <m>a_n, a_{n-1}, \dots, a_2, a_1, a_0 \in \mathbb{R}</m> are numbers, and <m>a_n \neq 0</m>. The coefficients of a polynomial function, <m>a_k</m> are given using subscripted letters. In general, <m>a_k</m> represents the coefficient of the term <m>x^k</m>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The <em>degree</em> of a polynomial function is the exponent on its highest power of <m>x</m>. Here, this is a polynomial of degree <m>n</m>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The term with the highest power of <m>x</m>, <m>a_n x^n</m>, is called the <em>leading term</em>, and its coefficient <m>a_n</m> is called the <em>leading coefficient</em>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </definition>

  <ul>
    <li>A constant function <m>f(x) = k</m> is a polynomial function of degree 0.</li>
    <li>A linear function, <m>f(x) = mx + b</m> (where <m>m \neq 0</m>), is a polynomial function of degree 1.</li>
    <li>A quadratic function <m>f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c</m> (where <m>a \neq 0</m>), is a polynomial function of degree 2.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Roughly, the higher the degree, the more complicated the polynomial is.
  </p>

  <p>
    The domain of a polynomial is all real numbers, or <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>, because it only requires addition, subtraction, and multiplication of numbers, and these operations are always defined.
  </p>

  <example>
    <title>Example</title>
    <p>
      The expression <m>4x^3 - 3.6x^2 - \sqrt{2}</m> is a polynomial of degree 3.
    </p>
  </example>

  <example>
    <title>Example</title>
    <p>
      The expression <m>x^{3/2} - x^4 + 1</m> is not a polynomial, as <m>3/2</m> is not a non-negative integer.
    </p>
  </example>

  <p>
    Polynomials of degree 3 are sometimes called \textbf{cubic}, degree 4 is \textbf{quartic}, degree 5 is \textbf{quintic}, and degree 6 is \textbf{sextic} or \textbf{hexic}.
  </p>
</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="graph-of-polynomial-function">
  <title>Graph of a Polynomial Function</title>
  <p>
    The graph of a polynomial function is both \textbf{smooth} (in that it contains no sharp corners) and \textbf{continuous} (it has no ``breaks" and can be drawn without lifting your pencil off the page).
  </p>
  <p>
    A polynomial has possibly multiple points where it turns around, going from increasing to decreasing, or vice versa. It turns out that a polynomial of degree <m>n</m> has at most <m>n - 1</m> turning points.
  </p>
</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="end-behavior">
  <title>End Behavior of Polynomial Functions</title>
  <p>
    As we've seen, sometimes polynomial functions go right and up, and sometimes they go right and down, and sometimes left and up and other times left and down. Whether a polynomial goes up or down on the right or left is what we call its \textit{end behavior}.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <title>End Behavior</title>
    <p>
      The \textbf{end behavior} of a function is its behavior as <m>x</m> becomes large in either the positive or negative direction. In other words, as <m>\abs{x}</m>, or the magnitude of <m>x</m>, becomes large.
    </p>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Graphically, end behavior is the behavior to the ``far right" or ``far left" side of the graph. The graph of a polynomial function may increase and decrease on different intervals, however it will ``eventually" tend towards some behavior.
  </p>

  <p>
    To describe end behavior, we often use a notation called \textbf{arrow notation},
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><m>x \to \infty</m> can be read as ``$x$ goes to infinity".</li>
    <li><m>x \to -\infty</m> is ``$x$ goes to negative infinity".</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>If the polynomial <m>f</m> increases without bound (goes up and up), we write <m>f(x) \to \infty</m>.</li>
    <li>If <m>f</m> decreases without bound (goes down and down), we write <m>f(x) \to -\infty</m>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Observe that the end behavior of a polynomial function is determined by the leading term. This is intuitively because when <m>x</m> is large (either large positive or large negative), the leading term dominates the other terms, in the sense that it's size is much larger than the others, to where the others are insignificant.
  </p>

  <p>
    This can be summarized in the \textit{leading coefficient test}.
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <title>Leading coefficient test</title>
    <md>
\begin{array}{c||c|c}
     \amp \text{odd degree} \amp \text{even degree} \\ \hline \hline
    \text{positive} \amp \begin{array}{c} f(x) \to \infty \text{ as } x \to \infty \\ f(x) \to -\infty \text{ as } x \to -\infty \end{array} \amp \begin{array}{c} f(x) \to \infty \text{ as } x \to \infty \\ f(x) \to \infty \text{ as } x \to -\infty \end{array} \\ \hline
    \text{negative} \amp \begin{array}{c} f(x) \to -\infty \text{ as } x \to \infty \\ f(x) \to \infty \text{ as } x \to -\infty \end{array} \amp \begin{array}{c} f(x) \to -\infty \text{ as } x \to \infty \\ f(x) \to -\infty \text{ as } x \to -\infty \end{array}
\end{array}
    </md>
  </theorem>

  <ul>
    <li>
      For an odd function, the sign of the leading coefficient determines the overall trend, when it overall has ``positive" or ``negative" slope. Odd-degree polynomial functions have graphs with opposite end behavior at each end.
    </li>
    <li>
      For an even function, the sign of the leading coefficient determines whether it ``opens up" or ``opens down". Even-degree polynomial functions have graphs with the same end behavior at each end.
    </li>
  </ul>
</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="y-intercept">
  <title>y-Intercept of a Polynomial Function</title>
  <p>
    Recall that the <m>y</m>-intercept for linear and quadratic functions is simply the constant term,
  </p>

  <md>
y = mx + b \amp \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad \text{$y$-int} = (0,b) \\
y = ax^2 + bx + c \amp \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad \text{$y$-int} = (0,c)
  </md>

  <p>
    More generally, the <m>y</m>-intercept of a polynomial function is <m>(0,a_0)</m>, the constant term, because <m>f(0) = a_0</m>.
  </p>

  <example>
    <title>Example</title>
    <p>
      For <m>f(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x - 4</m>, the <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>-4</m>.
    </p>
  </example>
</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="x-intercepts">
  <title>x-Intercepts of a Polynomial Function</title>
  <p>
    The <m>x</m>-intercept(s) of a polynomial function are the solutions to the equation <m>f(x) = 0</m>.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <title>Zero (Root) of a Function</title>
    <p>
      A number <m>c</m> is a \textbf{zero} or (\textbf{root}) of <m>f(x)</m> if <m>f(c) = 0</m>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The number <m>c</m> is a zero if and only if <m>c</m> is an <m>x</m>-intercept of the graph of <m>f(x)</m>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </definition>

  <p>
    We will explore various techniques in order to solve an equation like this. In general, solving this equation by hand and exactly is very difficult, and sometimes impossible.
  </p>
</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="remark">
  <title>Remark</title>
  <p>
    Technically, the zero polynomial <m>f(x) = 0</m> is said to have degree <m>-\infty</m>, not 0 (for technical reasons that will become clear later).
  </p>
</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="degree-product">
  <title>Degree of a Product of Polynomials</title>
  <theorem>
    <title>Degree of a Product</title>
    <p>
      The degree of a product of polynomials is the sum of the degrees. In particular, the product of <m>n</m> linear factors is a polynomial of degree <m>n</m>.
