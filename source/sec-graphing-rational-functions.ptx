    <title>Sketching the Graph of a Rational Function Summary</title>
    <p>We can use all the previous properties of rational functions in order to graph them. Then,</p>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <alert>Factor and simplify</alert>.
            <ul>
              <li>If possible, factor the numerator and denominator.</li>
              <li>Determine the domain of the function, which is all real numbers, except the roots of the denominator.</li>
              <li>Simplify by cancelling any common factors.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><alert>Find any holes</alert>. Cancelled factors of the form <m>x - c</m> will result in a hole at <m>x = c</m>, and the <m>y</m>-coordinate of these holes will come from evaluating the simplified function at <m>x = c</m>.</li>
        <li><p>Find properties of the function:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><alert>Find the y-intercept (if it exists)</alert>. The <m>y</m>-intercept comes from substituting <m>x = 0</m> (i.e. finding <m>f(0)</m>) (as long as 0 is in the domain of <m>f</m>).</li>
            <li><alert>Find any x-intercepts</alert>. Any <m>x</m>-intercepts of <m>f</m> are zeros of the numerator.</li>
            <li><alert>Find any vertical asymptotes</alert>. Any vertical asymptotes are from the zeros of the denominator.</li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <alert>Find the horizontal asymptote (or oblique asymptote)</alert>. Compare the degree of the numerator and the denominator.
                <ul>
                  <li>If <m>\text{num} \lt \text{denom}</m>, then the line <m>y = 0</m> (the <m>x</m>-axis) is the horizontal asymptote.</li>
                  <li>If <m>\text{num} = \text{denom}</m>, then the line <m>y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of num}}{\text{leading coefficient of denom}}</m>, the ratio of the leading coefficients, is the horizontal asymptote.</li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      If <m>\text{num} \gt \text{denom}</m>, then there is no horizontal asymptote.
                      <ul>
                        <li>If <m>\text{num} = \text{denom} + 1</m>, then there is an oblique (slant) asymptote. Find it using synthetic division or long division.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><alert>Plot additional points</alert>, if necessary. A good guideline is to have at least 1 point on each side of each vertical asymptote. Two points can be better if you need more detail.</li>
        <li><alert>Sketch the graph</alert> by connecting the points. The graph should get closer and closer to each asymptote. Be sure to not cross any vertical asymptote.</li>
      </ol>
