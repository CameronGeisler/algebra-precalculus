    <title>Application: Bouncing Ball Problem</title>
    <example>
      <title>Bouncing ball problem</title>
      <p>A ball is dropped from a height of 10 m. After each bounce, the ball bounces up to 80% of its previous height. Determine the total distance travelled by the ball. <url href="https://www.geogebra.org/m/eZPtyxBb">Bouncing Ball GeoGebra</url>.</p>
      <p>Sketch a picture of the situation. The sum of the distances is,
        <md>
          <mrow> = 10 + 2 \cdot 10 \cdot 0.8 + 2 \cdot 10 \cdot 0.8^2 + 2 \cdot 10 \cdot 0.8^3 + \dots </mrow>
        </md>
        It is better to write out the distances without doing the arithmetic, so that it is easier to recognize the pattern. This is a geometric series, except for the first number 10. Each next term is the same as the previous term, except multiplied by <m>0.8</m>. The first term of <m>2 \cdot 10 \cdot 0.8 = 16</m>, and the common ratio is <m>r = 0.8</m>,
        <md>
          <mrow>= 10 + \underbrace{2 \cdot 10 \cdot 0.8 + 2 \cdot 10 \cdot 0.8^2 + 2 \cdot 10 \cdot 0.8^3 + \dots}_{\text{geometric series, } a = 16, r = 0.8} </mrow>
        </md>
        Then, using the infinite geometric series formula,
        <md>
          <mrow>\amp = 10 + \frac{16}{1 - 0.8}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = 90 \text{ m}</mrow>
        </md>
        Therefore, the total distance travelled is 90 m.</p>

        <statement>
          <p>
            Consider the general problem. A ball is dropped from a height of <m>h</m> meters, and bounces up to a fraction <m>r</m> of the previous bounce (where <m>0 \lt r \lt 1</m>). Find the total distance travelled, in terms of <m>h</m> and <m>r</m>.
