  "body": " Rational Exponents and Radicals   Recall that previously, powers and exponents are a concise notation to write repeated multiplication. For example, means multiply 3, 4 times, or .  We can extend the definition of exponents to allow for exponents which are fractions (i.e. rational numbers). For example, expressions like,   At first, the previous definition of exponents as how many times you're multiplying doesn't seem to make sense. After all, for example, for , what does it mean to multiply 4 by itself 3\/2 times?   Suppose that we extend exponents to be allowed to be any rational number. Then, we want the laws of exponents to still work. In particular, the two fundamental laws,   Then, consider . By properties of exponents, we have,   This shows that multiplied by itself is equal to 3. In other words, . On the other hand, we know that multiplied by itself is equal to 3, or,   This means that and must be the same number, and so .   In general, for any number , if we multiply by itself, we get,   This means that , and so is the square root of .    Rational Exponents     In other words,   Technically, there are two numbers whose square is , which are and . We define to be the positive square root of .  In a similar way, for an exponent of , we have,   Therefore, , and so is the cube root of .   In general, this works for any exponent of the form .     Next, we want to define a rational exponent when the numerator is a number other than 1, like , or .   Consider . Recognize that is just , so,   And so . On the other hand,   And so . Putting both of them together, we get that all of these are equal,   and all of them are equal to 4.   In general,     This means that when raising a number to a fraction power ,    Take the th root and then raise to the th power.    Or: Raise it to the the th power and then take the th root.    In short,    Numerator exponent.    Denominator root index.    Some notes:    Decimal exponents can be thought of as fraction exponents. For example, .    Note that when evaluating expressions with rational exponents with a calculator, be sure to put parentheses around the fraction. Most calculators will evaluate as , because with order of operations, exponentiation is higher than division.    Note that this always works, except if is even and is negative, because we can't take the square root (or any even root) of a negative number.    We can also define negative rational exponents, in the same way as negative integer exponents.       Summary of Rational Exponents and Exponent Laws  In summary,   All of the laws of exponents also apply to rational exponents.    Exponent laws .      Converting Between Rational Exponents and Radicals    Write each expression in exponent form.                                              Write each expression in radical form.

  "body": " Factoring Quadratic Trinomials    Factoring quadratic trinomials is arguably the single most used skill in high-school mathematics, being used in uncountably many high-school (and college) math problems. In this way, it is a very important foundational skill to master. However, unfortunately, it is among the least important and least useful topics ``in the real world\".  The goal is to factor any expression of the form , where are any integers.   First, we'll start with a simpler case, when .  Then, we'll consider the more difficult case, when .     Factoring (Sum and Product Method)  We want to take an expression like , and rewrite it as . The question is: how to choose the two numbers to put in the brackets? Observe the pattern for how expansions work. For example, consider the expansion of ,   Here are some other expansions,   Observe how expanding the left side leads to the right side.   On the right side, there are always 3 terms: , an term, and a constant number term.  To get the coefficient of the middle term, you add the two numbers in the brackets.  To get the last constant term, you multiply those two numbers.   In other words,   In general, if we multiply two factors together, say and , we get,    The first term is always .  The coefficient of the middle term is the sum of and .  The last term is the product of and .   In summary,   This leads to a general rule for factoring an expression of the form .    Factoring  Consider,   We want two numbers that multiply to 12 and add to 7. There are many pairs of numbers that add to 7, so we'll start with numbers that multiply to 12. Our choices are:   Notice that if we choose 3 and 4, they also add to 7. So this is the correct combination. Then,     Factoring With Negative Numbers  Consider,   We want two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to . Here are the possible pairs of factors:   At first, it seems none of these add to . However, we can also have both of our numbers be negative, because two negative numbers also multiply to a positive. For example,   Then, and is the correct combination. Then,     Writing in Standard Form  Consider,   This is still a quadratic trinomial. At first glance, it's a bit different than the previous examples, because it's not written in the usual order for a quadratic. The highest power term, , is at the end instead of the beginning.  When factoring, you should always arrange the terms in the same order: first, next, and constant last. This is called descending power order (the exponent on from largest to smallest), and is often called standard form .   Now, it looks like a regular quadratic. We need two numbers that multiply to 12 and add to . After some guessing, the correct combination is and . Therefore,    In summary,   (If necessary) Arrange the trinomial in descending power order.  Find two numbers that multiply to (the last number), and check if they add to (the middle number).  If they do, then it factors as .    Practice Factoring Quadratics 1   Factor each quadratic expression.                                                                                                            Some additional helpful observations,   When the constant term is positive, then the factors of must be either both positive or both negative.  If the middle term is positive, then both must be positive. E.g. (last term is positive, middle term is positive, so both factors are positive)  If the middle term is negative, then both must be negative. E.g. (last term is positive, middle term is negative, so both factors are negative)    When the constant term is negative, then the factors of must have opposite signs (one positive, one negative). The sign of the larger number will be the sign of the coefficient of the middle term.  E.g. (last term is negative, so signs are opposite, and middle term is negative, so and 3 is negative)  E.g. (last term is negative, so signs are opposite, and middle term is positive, so and the 5 is positive)      Trinomial That Cannot Be Factored  In fact, not all trinomials can be factored. Consider . To factor this, we would need two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to 4. The options are: or . Neither of them work. This means that is not factorable.   Polynomials which cannot be factored are called prime , or irreducible . Prime in the same way as a prime number like 7 cannot be factored into smaller pieces, and irreducible similarly means not reducible . For now, problems will almost always have only factorable polynomials.   Practice Factoring Trinomials   Factor each trinomial.                                                                                                              Factoring Trinomials with Common Factors  Sometimes the trinomial is set up so that (the number in front of is not 1), however, there is a common factor that can be factored out, reducing the expression to one which can be factored using the previous method.   Factoring Completely   Factor each quadratic expression completely.                                              Factoring Polynomials of the form ,  There are many methods for factoring these kinds of polynomials. Different teachers will teach different methods. All of them end up with the same result, but some are more efficient than others.  Here, I will explain the cross method, because I personally believe it is the most efficient and easiest method to use.    The Cross Method   Introduction to the Cross Method  Consider,   To do the cross method,   Draw a crisscross or X shape underneath.  On the left side, put two things that multiply to the first term, and on the right, put two things that multiply to the last term.  Multiply each of the diagonals and add them up.  The combination is correct if the diagonals add up to the middle term.   For example,      On the left side, , and on the right, . However, the diagonals add up to , which isn't the middle term. Instead, switch the 3 and the 1,      We now get , which is the middle term. After you've found the correct combination, the two factors can be read horizontally in each row,        Cross Method With Negative Numbers  Consider,   Using the cross method, one possible combination is,      On the left side, , and on the right, . However, the diagonals add up to , which isn't the middle term, so this isn't correct. Instead, switch the 2 and the ,      Now the diagonals add to , which is not quite , but it's close. To fix it, just change the negative sign on the right to be on the 2 instead of the 1,      Now the diagonals add up to , which matches the middle term. Reading across gives the factors:        Cross Method With Multiple Factor Pairs  Consider,   For the left side, we have 6, which means we could choose 6 and 1, or 3 and 2. We don't know ahead of time which will be correct, so let's choose 6 and 1, and we can change it later.      The diagonals add up to , which is too large. Let's switch the 2 and 5,      Now the diagonals are , which is close but still not 19. Try different factor pairs of 10: and .      Now the diagonals are , still not enough. Switching gives,      Now we get , too large. We've tried all of the possible combinations on the right side, so this means that the left side is wrong. Let's try and instead.      Now the diagonals add to , perfect! Reading across gives,       The cross method requires some guessing and checking (or trial and error), especially at first. However, with some practice and gain experience, you'll become more experienced at making educated guesses for the combinations that are more likely to work, so you won't have to naively go through every single combination. Also, sometimes you get lucky and find the correct combination right away.   Using the Cross Method When  The cross method can also be used in the previous simpler case, when . For example, for,   We could think of factors of that add up to , which are and 4, to get,   However, we can also use the cross method. The first term is , so we can write and on the left side, and the last term is , so we can try and on the right side. Then, we draw a crisscross or X shape, multiply the diagonals, and add them up. The combination is correct if the diagonals add up to the middle term.       This gives the same answer as before.    Factor Out the Negative Sign First  Consider . In this case, which is negative, unlike the previous examples. You could continue just like before, by finding two things that multiply to and 3. For example,         However, it turns out that the negative sign on the left side makes things more complicated, because you have to worry about where to put the negative sign on the left side (in addition to the right side being either 3 and 1 or and ). There are a lot of negative signs, and it can get confusing.  Instead, it's better to first factor out the negative sign in the front. To do this, factor out from all terms, which basically flips the sign of all the terms,   Then, factor the expression inside the brackets as before. Now, you don't need to worry about the sign on the left column, and the only sign choice for the , where one of the numbers must be negative.        In general, if the value is negative, factor out from all terms first, and then factor the remaining polynomial.   Factor Out the GCF Before Using the Cross Method  Consider,   Here, we can still use the cross method. However, the numbers are kinda large, especially 30, which has many possibilities for its factors. After some trial and error, the correct combination is,      However, notice that also contains a common factor of 2, so to fully factor, we should factor it out also.   Alternatively, it is easier to first factor out the common factor of 2,   Then, factoring the remaining only uses the sum and product method (what multiplies to and adds to ), and has smaller numbers to work with. After some guessing, and 3 works,    In general, if there is a common factor among all of the terms, then you should first factor out the GCF (greatest common factor), before using the cross method. This makes the numbers you have to work with smaller, making it easier to find the factors.   Practice Factoring General Quadratics 1   Factor each expression fully.

If the leading coefficient (the number in front of ) is negative, factor out from all terms (basically, flip the sign of each term).       If ( ), find two numbers that multiply to and add to .  If ( ), use the cross method.     (Optional) To check your answer, you can expand (FOIL) and check if you get back the original expression.    "

  "body": " Factoring Special Patterns    Difference of Squares   Intro Examples  When multiplying two binomials that are almost the same, except for one having a positive sign and one having a negative, there is a special pattern. Observe the expansion,   Notice that the middle terms and cancel out.   In general, when expanding an expression of the form (where the two numbers are opposites of each other), the middle two terms always cancel out, because they are opposites of each other. The result is squared, minus the number squared.   In general,   This identity for expanding can be thought of in reverse, as an identity for factoring,   In other words, for an expression of the form (where there are two things being squared, and they're subtracted), it can be factored as . It's called difference of squares , difference because of the minus sign, and squares because both terms are perfect squares.   For example, is a difference of squares, because it's squared, and 9 is , so,     Factor Each Expression   Factor each expression.                 First factor out the common factor of 2.              First factor out the common factor of 3.          You can write the minus factor or the plus factor first. The order doesn't matter. For example,     Factor  Here, we have instead of . However, it is still a difference of squares, because and .   This basically means that we're applying the same difference of squares pattern , where and .   In general, difference of squares applies when:    There are two terms.    There is a minus sign between them.    Each term is a perfect square (the square of something).    A term is a perfect square if both its coefficient (the number part) and its variable part are perfect squares. In general, to figure out what goes in the brackets, rewrite each term as a square,    Ask: What squares to make the first term? This is the first thing in the brackets.    Ask: What squares to make the second term? This is the second thing in the brackets.    Then, write those two answers twice, one with a minus and one with a plus.     Factor Each Expression   Factor each expression.                                                                                If an expression has only 2 terms, this is a good indicator that difference of squares could work.   Factor Each Expression Fully   Factor each expression fully.

The sum of squares has no factorization pattern. In other words, there is no pattern for . For example, these have no factorization:                Perfect Square Trinomials  Another special pattern comes from expanding the square of a binomial.   Expanding Squares of Binomials   Consider these expansions,   Observe the pattern of the 3 resulting terms.   The 1st term is the square of the 1st term in the binomial.  The 3rd term is the square of the 2nd term in the binomial.  The middle (2nd) term is the product of the 2 terms in the binomial, multiplied by 2.     In general,   Also, if there is a negative number, we can say,   Reversing this identity gives a factoring identity for trinomials of this special form.    Factoring Perfect Square Trinomials I   Factor each perfect square trinomial.                        These are called perfect square trinomials , because they can be written as a perfect square. To recognize if it is one,   Are the 1st and 3rd terms squares?  Is the middle term double the product? Take the square roots of the first and last terms, multiply them together, and multiply by 2. If it matches the middle term, then it is a perfect square trinomial.   Sometimes, you must first factor out a GCF, before the remaining expression is a perfect square.   Factoring Perfect Square Trinomials II   Factor each expression fully.                                        Technically, recognizing perfect square trinomials is optional, since you could instead just factor it as a trinomial instead (for example, using the cross method). However, being able to recognize this pattern can save a bit of time from trial-and-error.   Factoring Perfect Square Trinomials III   Factor each expression fully.

  "body": " Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring   Previously, we learned:   If a quadratic equation is factored, then it is easy to solve.  How to factor quadratics in the form .   Combining these give us a powerful strategy for solving quadratic equations. First however, we need to make sure the equation is in the correct form,   This is called standard form , as it is the conventional, agreed-upon way to write a quadratic equation. This is because this form makes solving the equation consistent each time. To do this, move all terms to one side of the equation, and arrange the terms with the first, the term next, and the constant last.    Summary   (If necessary) Write in standard form, by moving all terms to one side so that the equation equals zero. E.g.   (If necessary) Look for common factors, if all terms share a common factor, divide it out first.  Factor the trinomial.  Find the value of that makes each factor 0.   Some notes:   If is a factor of the polynomial, then is a solution to the equation.  Always look for common factors, because it makes the problem more simple.

Factoring.   However, in fact, many quadratic expressions are not factorable, and not nicely written as a square. In this case, we'll develop another technique, called completing the square .   Motivation for Completing the Square  Recall that we have solved quadratic equations of the form by taking the square root of both sides. For example, to solve ,   Therefore, if we could convert an equation to this form, we could solve it. To see how to do this, expand the left side first, and write it in standard form,   This means the equations and are equivalent. The expression can't be factored nicely (there are no factors of 4 that add up to ). However, observe that all of the algebra steps are reversible. That is,   This is a strategy to solve the equation. However, how would we know what number to add to the left-hand side? In other words, how would we know that we need so that can be rewritten as ? We need a number to add to to make it a perfect square.    Perfect Square Trinomial Pattern  Recall that a perfect square trinomial is one that can be factored as a square. For example,   Observe the pattern of how each left side and right side looks like. To go from the number in front of (the number), to the constant number, you need to divide by 2, and square it (multiply it by itself). Also, the number inside the brackets is just the half number (the number divided by 2).    For more about perfect square trinomials, see .   In general, for a perfect square trinomial of this form, the constant term is of the coefficient of the term, squared. In other words,   This means to get the correct constant term, take the coefficient of ,   Divide it by 2 (or take 1\/2 of it)  Square it.    Recognizing Perfect Square Trinomials   Find a number that makes the expression a perfect square of the form .                 Solve  The expression is not factorable, so we'll use this technique. First, move the constant to the other side,   Next, we want to add a number to both sides so that the left side becomes a perfect square trinomial. The coefficient of is 8. Half of 8 is 4, and . So we add 16 to both sides,   Now the left side is a perfect square trinomial, which factors as ,   Now we can use the square root property,   Therefore, or .   This process is called completing the square , because we are literally completing a perfect square by adding a number to it.   Solve  First, move the constant to the other side,   The coefficient of is 4. Half of 4 is 2, and . So we add 4 to both sides,   Now we need to take the square root of both sides. However, there is no real number whose square is , because the square of any real number is always positive (or 0). Therefore, there is no solution.   This gives a technique for solving quadratic equations:   Isolate the terms involving , by moving the constant to the other side.  Find , and add it to both sides of the equation.  Factor the perfect square trinomial.  Take square roots of both sides (don't forget )  Isolate for .    Solve by Completing the Square I   Solve each equation by completing the square.          no solution        Solve by Completing the Square II   Solve each equation by completing the square.        Solve  This equation could be solved by factoring, as,   However, completing the square also works in this simpler case. First, move the constant to the other side,   The coefficient of is . Half of is , and . So we add 9 to both sides,   Now the left side is a perfect square trinomial, which factors as ,   Now we can take the square root of both sides,   Therefore, or .    Solve  Notice here, the leading coefficient ( ) is not 1 (it is 2). In this case, first divide both sides by that number.   Now, we can complete the square just like before. Move the constant to the other side,   The coefficient of is . Half of is , and . So we add 4 to both sides,   Therefore, or .   In general, if the leading coefficient is not 1 (in other words, if ), then first divide by that number on both sides, and continue just like before.   Solve by Completing the Square III   Solve each equation by completing the square.   ( )  ( )  ( )  ( )  ( )  no solution  ( )   Summary of Solving by Completing the Square  In summary, completing the square is a general technique for solving quadratic equations, particularly those which can't be factored. It also works for equations which can be factored, but it is overkill (because factoring is easier).      Steps  Example: Solve    1. Move the constant to the other side.     2. If , divide both sides by .     3. Find , add it to both sides.     4. Factor the perfect square trinomial.     5. Take square roots (don't forget ).     6. Isolate .      You can check your final answers, by plugging them in for in the original equation, and seeing if both sides are equal.

This allows us to identify the vertex of the parabola.    Convert to Vertex Form  The key insight is that we can use the same completing the square technique, but on a function expression rather than an equation. The goal is to rewrite in the form .  We need to add a number to to make it a perfect square. Half of 6 is 3, and . But if we add 9, we must also subtract 9 to keep the expression equal:   The vertex is .    Convert to Vertex Form  When , we first factor out from the terms:   Now complete the square inside the parentheses. Half of is , and :   The vertex is .    Convert to Vertex Form  When is negative, we factor out the negative:   Complete the square inside. Half of is , and :   The vertex is .   The process is similar to solving equations, with a few key differences:   Factor out from the first two terms, and leave some space to add and subtract.  Complete the square inside the brackets.  If you factor out , you must add the constant inside the bracket, but you're really adding to the expression, so also subtract to maintain equality.  The final bracket inherits the sign from (if is positive, then positive; if is negative, then negative).

Intuitively, if two numbers have to add up to 20, then for example, if one of the numbers is 5, the other must be 15. If one is 8, then the other must be 12. In general, to get the 2nd number, take 20 minus the 1st number. We want to know which 2 numbers to pick so that their product (multiplying them together) is as big as possible. For example, let's try guessing and testing,    1 and 19 product of 19    5 and 15 product of 75 (bigger)    8 and 12 product of 96 (even bigger)    10 and 10 product of 100    If you choose the 1st number to be bigger, it repeats the same pattern. For example, 12 and 8 is the same as 8 and 12.    It seems like 10 and 10 gives the biggest product, but we can show this using algebra.    Let be the 1st number. Then, is the 2nd number, because they both must add up to 20. Their product (say, ) is,   We want the maximum of this function, which is its vertex. There are 2 approaches to find its vertex.

Intuitively, if two numbers have to add up to 20, then for example, if one of the numbers is 5, the other must be 15. If one is 8, then the other must be 12. In general, to get the 2nd number, take 20 minus the 1st number. We want to know which 2 numbers to pick so that their product (multiplying them together) is as big as possible. For example, let's try guessing and testing,    1 and 19 product of 19    5 and 15 product of 75 (bigger)    8 and 12 product of 96 (even bigger)    10 and 10 product of 100    If you choose the 1st number to be bigger, it repeats the same pattern. For example, 12 and 8 is the same as 8 and 12.    It seems like 10 and 10 gives the biggest product, but we can show this using algebra.    Let be the 1st number. Then, is the 2nd number, because they both must add up to 20. Their product (say, ) is,   We want the maximum of this function, which is its vertex. There are 2 approaches to find its vertex.    It's already in factored form, so its zeros are and . Therefore, its vertex is halfway between them at . Then, the 1st number should be 10 in order to maximize the product. Then, the 2nd number is also 10. The maximum product is .    Expand,   The vertex is at , so,   so the 1st number is 10, the 2nd number is 10, and the maximum product is 100.     "

This means that the quadratic roughly looks like this,     From this, the parabola is negative when is between and , or .   To solve the inequality, we don't need to graph the entire parabola precisely. Instead, we only need to find the roots, and know the basic shape (opening up or down).  A quadratic expression can only change sign at its roots. This means, if a quadratic has two roots, then:   If the quadratic is positive in one interval, it will switch to negative when crossing a root.  After crossing the second root, it switches back to positive.   If the quadratic opens down, then the pattern is reversed: it first is negative, then positive, then negative. The pattern of signs follows,     Solving Quadratic Inequalities with Scientific Calculator (INEQ Mode)  My recommended calculator Casio fx-991ES PLUS C 2nd edition (or another similar model) can actually solve quadratic inequalities for you. You can use this to check your answers after solving by hand.   Press MODE and use the down arrow key to go to the next page.  Press 1 for inequality mode ( INEQ )  Press 1 for a quadratic inequality ( ).   Next, the calculator will show options for the type of inequality:   Press 1 for (greater than)  Press 2 for (less than)  Press 3 for (greater than or equal to)  Press 4 for (less than or equal to)    Enter the coefficients , , and for your inequality.  Press = to solve.  The calculator will show the interval(s) of that satisfy the inequality.    For example, to solve :   Press MODE , scroll down, and select INEQ .  Choose 1 for quadratic.  Choose 1 for .  Input , , .   Press = to solve. The calculator will show the solution as:     Make sure your inequality is written in the correct form (everything on one side of the inequality, on the other).     Solving Quadratic Inequalities Summary    A quadratic inequality is an inequality that can be written in one of the forms,      (If necessary) Arrange the quadratic inequality in standard form, with on one side, and 0 on the other.  Find the critical values (the roots of the quadratic expression), by solving the corresponding quadratic equation .  Sketch a number line, and mark the critical values to split it into 3 intervals.   Find where the quadratic is positive or negative   If it opens up ( ), the sign pattern is .  If it opens down ( ), the sign pattern is .    Choose the intervals that match the inequality symbol (greater than or less than).  Include the endpoints if the inequality is or (non-strict inequality). Don't include the endpoints if it's or .     Solving Using Sign Chart and Test Points  There is another method to solve a quadratic inequality, that is more systematic and general, but less efficient for quadratic inequalities, called the sign chart method , or test point method .   Consider the inequality . Similar to before, first find the critical values, by factoring,   So, the critical values are and . Set up a number line, with these roots marked,     These roots split up the number line into 3 intervals: , , and . For each of these intervals, the quadratic will either be positive everywhere, or negative everywhere. So, it is enough to test a single point, and see if the quadratic is positive or negative. For example,    For , choose :     For , choose :     For , choose :     To illustrate these results, we can put a or above each interval, depending if it's positive or negative.     This means that the solution is or . We can denote this graphically by highlighting those regions.     We use open circles (basically, hollow circles) to indicate that and are not included in the solution, because the inequality is .  In fact, when doing test points, we only need to know the sign of the output (whether it is positive or negative). Its exact value as a number isn't necessary. Recall that with multiplying positive and negative numbers,   Then, testing points could look like this,   Test :  Test :  Test :     The roots of the parabola are called critical points , because they are the important points that indicate where the parabola can change sign from positive to negative, or vice versa.  The number line with labelled and intervals is called a sign chart , and this method is sometimes called the test point method .   In summary, after finding the critical values,   Choose a test point in each interval, and evaluate the quadratic function there to determine if it is positive or negative, i.e. if that interval is in the solution set.    Some teachers require you to use a more elaborate table to do a sign chart. I personally believe this chart is excessively tedious and doesn't add much, but some teachers require it to properly show your work.      Examples   Solve  First, find the critical values by solving the corresponding equation,   So, the critical values are and . These divide the number line into three intervals. Since the leading coefficient is positive ( ), the parabola opens up, so the sign pattern is .

The quadratic formula always works, in that it can be used in all cases. However, it is sometimes overkill, applying a complicated formula to a simple situation unnecessarily, where a simpler technique would have worked.

Rationalizing a Simple Fraction   Consider the fraction , which has in the denominator. To eliminate the square root in the denominator, we can multiply it by (since ). If we multiply the denominator by , we also have to multiply the numerator, so that the number's value is not changed. Then,   Therefore,     Rationalizing the denominator only changes the form of the number, not its value. Most of the time, it is considered poor form to leave a radical in the denominator of a final answer (this is analogous to giving a fraction final answer not in reduced form, like putting instead of ). Basically, it is considered to look nicer , so it is a standard form to write final answers, so that it is easy to compare if two answers are the same.    Rationalizing the Denominator  In general, to rationalize the denominator with a square root,    (Ideally) Simplify radicals, if possible.

Just input the radical expression, and press equals. You can use to at least check your answer.    Rationalizing the Denominator with Higher Roots  In general, multiply the numerator and denominator by whatever is required to get a perfect th power in the the radical we want to get rid of.

  "body": " Intro to Rational Expressions   Recall that a fraction, or rational number , is a number that can be written by dividing two integers (like , or ). A rational expression is similar, except with variables.    Rational Expressions    A rational expression is an algebraic expression of the form, In other words, it is the quotient of two polynomials.   It's also called an algebraic fraction , as opposed to a regular fraction which only involves numbers.      Identifying Rational Expressions  For example, these are all rational expressions,     ( , being just a constant, is still considered a polynomial)  (polynomials can have multiple different variables)   However, these are not rational expressions:   , because is not a polynomial.  , because is not a polynomial.     Polynomials as Rational Expressions  All polynomials are technically also considered rational expressions, because any polynomial can be written as itself divided by 1 (and 1 is a polynomial also). For example,      Non-Permissible Values  A rational expression is not defined if their denominator is 0, because division by zero is undefined. Values of (or whatever the variable is) that make the denominator 0 are called non-permissible values .    The non-permissible values ( NPV s) of a rational expressions are the values of the variable(s) that make the denominator 0.   Also called restrictions , or excluded values .     To determine the non-permissible values of a rational expression, figure out what values of will make the denominator 0.   Basic Non-Permissible Values  Find the non-permissible values of the rational expression,   This is when is equal to 0. You may be able to observe that this is when . Or, you can set equal to 0 and solve for . Therefore, the NPV is .   The purpose of NPVs is to communicate what values of the variable are not allowed to be plugged into the expression.   NPVs with Difference of Squares  Find the non-permissible values of,   The denominator is , so the NPVs are the values that make . To solve this, one way is to factor it as a difference of squares, then set each factor equal to 0 and solve for . Therefore, the NPVs are . Alternatively, you could take square roots,     No Non-Permissible Values  Find the non-permissible values of,   The denominator is , so the NPVs are when, To solve this, you may recognize that the left side is always positive, so it is never equal to 0, and so there is no solution. Or, isolate for , Then, there is no number such that (in other words, the equation has no solution), so the denominator is never 0. Therefore, there are no NPVs.    NPVs with Trinomial Factoring  Find the non-permissible values of,   The NPVs are when, We can factor, then set each factor equal to 0 and solve. Therefore, the NPVs are .    NPVs with Multiple Variables  Find the non-permissible values of,   The denominator is , so the NPVs are when, This is a product of two variables, so it is equal to 0 precisely when either or . Both of these make the denominator 0, so both must be excluded. Therefore, the NPVs are and .    NPVs with Common Factors  Find the non-permissible values of,   The NPVs are when, You can factor out a common factor of , then set each factor equal to 0 and solve for . Therefore, the NPVs are .    NPVs Using Quadratic Formula  Find the non-permissible values of,   The NPVs are when, In fact, this quadratic does not factor, so we must use the quadratic formula. Therefore, the NPVs are .   In summary, to find non-permissible values, find the zeros of the denominator, by setting it equal to 0 and solving for .  Note: the non-permissible values do not depend on what the numerator is at all , only on what the denominator is.   Practice Exercises   Find all non-permissible values (if any) for each rational expression.                 none                         ,             none         the quadratic does not factor      difference of squares      "

Summary of Simplifying Rational Expressions    Factor the numerator and denominator as much as possible (if there are multiple terms, with addition or subtraction).  If there is multiplication only, there is no factoring needed.      Cancel common factors .  Remember: only factors can cancel (not terms, which are added or subtracted).  Sometimes, common factors will differ by a constant factor like .     Rewrite the fraction , with what's left after cancelling.  Find restrictions (if needed).

  "body": " Multiplying and Dividing Rational Expressions   Recall that to multiply fractions, we simply multiply their numerators together and their denominators together (separately). Also, after doing the multiplication, we can sometimes cancel common factors to reduce the fraction to lowest terms.   Multiplying Fractions Example  For example, to multiply by ,   Therefore, .   In general, the rule for multiplying fractions is,   Alternatively, we can cancel common factors before multiplying.   Cancelling Before Multiplying  For example, to multiply , we can cancel the on the top with the on the bottom, to make and ,    Rational expressions are multiplied in a similar way, by multiplying their numerators together and their denominators together.    Multiplying Rational Expressions    To multiply two rational expressions, multiply their numerators and multiply their denominators. That is, if are polynomials, then,   as long as and are not equal to 0.    For example,   However, if we first multiply and expand the expressions in the numerator and denominator, then the polynomials will get complicated and it will be more difficult to cancel common factors, in order to simplify. Instead, we want to factor each expression first, cancel common factors, and then multiply the result left over.    Factors in any numerator can be cancelled with factors in any denominator. In other words, we can cancel up and down but also diagonally .    Cancelling common factors result in 1.    A good strategy is to first focus on factoring (factor everything), then look for cancellations after.    Note: Multiplication can be denoted by or , and also sometimes by brackets. In other words, each of these means the same thing:       Dividing Rational Expressions  Recall that when dividing rational numbers, this is equivalent to multiplying by the reciprocal of the second number, and then multiply like before. You may remember this rule as keep, change, flip (meaning, keep the first fraction the same, change the sign to multiplication, and flip the 2nd fraction).   Dividing Fractions Example  For example, to divide ,   Therefore, .   In general,   Rational expressions are divided similarly, i.e. when dividing by a rational expression, multiply by its reciprocal.    To divide two rational expressions, multiply by the reciprocal of the denominator. That is, if are polynomials, then,   where are non-zero.    Remember: keep change flip.

Recall that to add fractions, you need to have the denominators be equal, and then you add the numerators.   Adding Two Fractions  For example, to add , we simply add the numerators, because the denominators are the same,    In general, if the denominators are the same (that is, we have a common denominator), then simply add the numerators together over that common denominator. That is,   If the denominators are not equal, then we need to first manipulate the fractions so that they have a common denominator.   Adding Two Fractions with Different Denominators  For example, to add , we have denominators of 9 and 3, so we can make a common denominator of 9, by multiplying by ,    Sometimes, to make a common denominator, you need to manipulate both fractions.   Adding Two Fractions with Different Denominators  For example, to add , we have denominators of 5 and 7, so we need a common denominator of (which is ),              Adding Rational Expressions   Adding Rational Expressions with Like Denominators  To add , add the numerators over the common denominator of ,     Adding Rational Expressions with Like Denominators  To add , add the numerators together over the common denominator of ,    To add two rational expressions with like denominators, add their numerators and keep the same denominator.

Adding Rational Expressions and Simplifying  For example,      Summary of Adding or Subtracting Rational Expressions    Factor the denominators completely.    Create a common denominator, by manipulating each fraction.    After you have a common denominator, add or subtract the numerators, and keep that common denominator.

  "title": "Word Problems with Rational Equations",
  "body": " Word Problems with Rational Equations   Some word problem situations lead to a rational equation. There are 3 broad categories of problems:   Work problems.  Rate\/speed problems.  Current\/wind problems.   These are very standard categories, so be sure to master each one. Also, review Word Problem Solving Strategy for learning how to think about word problems broadly.    Work Problems (Combined Work Rate)  In these problems, two people or machines work together at different rates to complete a task.   Painting a Wall  Alex can paint a wall in 4 hours. Brianna can paint the same wall in 6 hours. If they work together and do not stop, how long will it take them to paint the wall?  We want to find the time it takes for Alex and Brianna to paint the wall together, so let be the number of hours it takes them to paint the wall, working together.  Think about what happens as time passes. If Alex can finish 1 whole wall in 4 hours, then,   After 1 hour, he has finished of the wall.  After 2 hours, he's finished of the wall.  After 3 hours, he's finished .  In general, after hours, he has finished the fraction of the wall.   Similarly, Brianna can finish the wall in 6 hours, so,   After 1 hour, she's finished of the wall.  After 2 hours, she's finished .  And in general, after hours, she has finished of the wall.   Working together, after hours they have finished one whole wall, or 1 of the wall. Then,   Then,   Then, to solve this equation, clear the denominators by multiplying both sides by 12 (the LCD),   Therefore, together, they would take 2.4 hours. This is reasonable, because since they are working together, it will take somewhat less time than either of them working individually (4 hours or 6 hours).  Another way to organize this information is in a table, with 3 columns: the time it takes, the fraction done in 1 hour, and the fraction done in hours.   Another equivalent way to do this is to add the contributions after 1 hour, which gives,   This equation is equivalent to the previous equation, and so will also give the correct answer. However, I don't think it's as intuitive as the previous one.   In general,    Taps Filling a Tub  A cold tap can fill a tub in 2 minutes, and a hot tap can fill the same tub in 3 minutes. If both taps are turned on at the same time, how long will it take to fill the tub?  .  minutes.    Painting a House  Together, Anna and Isla can paint a house in 17 hours. Alone, Anna can do the job 3 hours faster than Isla. How long does each person take to paint the house, to the nearest tenth of an hour?  , where is Anna's time in hours.  Anna takes about hours, Isla takes about hours.    Filling a Container  The cold tap fills a container 2 hours faster than the hot tap. Together they fill it in 80 minutes. Find how long each tap takes alone.  , where is the cold tap time in hours.  Cold tap 2 hours, hot tap 4 hours.    Hoses Filling a Pool  Two hoses fill a pool in 2 hours together. Hose A alone fills it in 3 hours. How long would hose B alone take?  .  6 hours.    Painting a Large Room  It would take Sue 4 hours to paint a large room, and it would take Bob 5 hours to paint the same room. If they work together, how long would it take them to complete the job?  .  hours.    Three Workers  One worker takes 20 hours to do a job. A second worker can do the same job in 15 hours. When a third worker is added, it takes the three of them 6 hours to do the job. How long would it take the third worker to do the job alone?  .  20 hours.    Cleaning the Kitchen  Jane works twice as fast as her daughter Anna. If it takes 15 minutes to clean the kitchen together, how long would it take Anna to clean the kitchen by herself?  , where is Anna's time in minutes.  45 minutes.    Assembling a Motor  Ken takes 3 hours longer to assemble a motor than Hans. When working together, it takes them 2 hours to assemble the motor. How long would it take Ken to do the job alone?  , where is Hans's time in hours.  Ken would take 6 hours alone (Hans would take 3 hours).    Brick Layer and Apprentice  A brick layer can build a wall in 6 hours, and his apprentice would need 16 hours to build the same wall. When they work together, the apprentice works 5 hours longer than the brick layer. How many hours does each work?  , where is the brick layer's working time in hours.  The brick layer works 3 hours and the apprentice works 8 hours.    Taps and Drain  A cold water tap can fill a tub in 6 minutes, and a hot water tap can fill the tub in 8 minutes. A drain can empty a full tub in 10 minutes. If both taps are on and the drain is open, how long will it take to fill the tub?  .  min.    Delivering Flyers  When they work together, Stuart and Lucy can deliver flyers to all the homes in their neighbourhood in 42 minutes. When Lucy works alone, she can finish the deliveries in 13 minutes less time than Stuart can when he works alone. When Stuart works alone, how long does he take to deliver the flyers?  , where is Stuart's time in minutes.  Stuart takes 91 minutes alone (Lucy takes 78 minutes).    Harvesting Wheat  Nikita can harvest her wheat crop in 72 hours. Her neighbour's combine can do it in 48 hours. How long will both machines take together?  .  They will take hours working together.    Lyle Filling the Bathtub  Lyle can fill the bathtub using the cold water tap in 8 minutes. When both the hot and cold water taps are fully open, he can fill the bathtub in 6 minutes. How long would it take Lyle to fill the bathtub using only the hot water tap?  .  24 minutes.    Staining a Deck  A painter can stain a deck using a sprayer in 4 hours. When two people work together, one using the sprayer and the other using a brush, they can finish the job in 3 hours. How long would it take one person to stain the deck using only a brush?  .  6 hours.    Cleaning the Garage  Jenny can clean out the garage in 5 hours.

Relative Speed Comparison Problems   Jess and Sarah  Jess can run 3 miles per hour faster than her sister Sarah can walk. If Jess ran 12 miles in the same time it took Sarah to walk 8 miles, what is the speed of each sister?  We want to find the speed of each sister, so we can let be the speed of one sister, and then the other one differs by 3. Let be Sarah's speed. Then, Jess's speed is 3 mi\/h more, so it's (Note that you could have instead let be Jess's speed, and then Sarah would be ). We know they took the same amount of time, so,   Then, remember how speed, distance, and time are related by (or , or ). We'll use here because we want time.

  "body": " Painting a Wall  Alex can paint a wall in 4 hours. Brianna can paint the same wall in 6 hours. If they work together and do not stop, how long will it take them to paint the wall?  We want to find the time it takes for Alex and Brianna to paint the wall together, so let be the number of hours it takes them to paint the wall, working together.  Think about what happens as time passes. If Alex can finish 1 whole wall in 4 hours, then,   After 1 hour, he has finished of the wall.  After 2 hours, he's finished of the wall.  After 3 hours, he's finished .  In general, after hours, he has finished the fraction of the wall.   Similarly, Brianna can finish the wall in 6 hours, so,   After 1 hour, she's finished of the wall.  After 2 hours, she's finished .  And in general, after hours, she has finished of the wall.   Working together, after hours they have finished one whole wall, or 1 of the wall. Then,   Then,   Then, to solve this equation, clear the denominators by multiplying both sides by 12 (the LCD),   Therefore, together, they would take 2.4 hours. This is reasonable, because since they are working together, it will take somewhat less time than either of them working individually (4 hours or 6 hours).  Another way to organize this information is in a table, with 3 columns: the time it takes, the fraction done in 1 hour, and the fraction done in hours.   Another equivalent way to do this is to add the contributions after 1 hour, which gives,   This equation is equivalent to the previous equation, and so will also give the correct answer. However, I don't think it's as intuitive as the previous one.  "

In general, we call this a polynomial function. So, linear and quadratic functions are specific types of polynomial functions.   Exploring Polynomial Graphs  Let's explore polynomial functions. We'll start with the most basic types, which are just a single power of . We can graph polynomial functions using Desmos.    Exploration of power functions . Consider the graphs of , , , , , . Observe the pattern in the shapes.  Even integer powers have a U-shape whereas the odd integer powers have an S-shape .    Power functions with negatives . Consider , , , , , . These are basically the previous graphs except upside down . In other words, a reflection over the -axis of the previous graphs.     functions with more terms . Consider adding terms with smaller exponents. Take a function that starts with , and add some terms like , , or a constant.       Observe that the first 3 all have the same S-shape, that starts in the bottom left and ends in the top right. The last 2 also share similar shapes, starting in the top left and ending in the bottom right. Observe that the negative sign in front basically reflects it upside down. The precise behavior of the function and how it goes up and down is much more complicated, however, and can't be determined just by looking at the equation.     functions with more terms . Let's do the same thing, but with an function.      Again, observe that they all have the same U-shape , and the ones with a negative in front are basically upside down.   In fact, you have seen this pattern before with parabolas (quadratic functions). Quadratic functions with various numbers . Recall that the number in front of (called the leading coefficient ) determines if it opens up or opens down . In particular, if it opens up, and if it opens down.   In summary,   The rough shape of a polynomial function is determined by the term with the highest power of .   In particular, it is based on:  The biggest exponent the polynomial has.  If the number in front is positive or negative.         Polynomial Functions  Basically, a polynomial function is made up of powers of , combined with numbers through multiplication, addition, and subtraction. Sometimes, we refer to them simply as polynomials.   Roughly, a polynomial function is a function made up of adding and subtracting powers of with whole number exponents.    The degree of a polynomial function is the exponent on its highest power of .  Intuitively, degree means size , the degree of a polynomial can be thought of as how big it is.      The term with the highest power of is called the leading term , and its coefficient is called the leading coefficient .  Intuitively, leading means most important or in front .       The domain of a polynomial is all real numbers, or (or, ). This is because it only uses the basic operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication of numbers, and these operations are always defined.  The graph of a polynomial function is both:    Smooth : it has no sharp corners.   Continuous : it has no breaks and can be drawn without lifting your pencil off the page.    Polynomial and Non-Polynomial Functions  Here are some functions which are polynomials, and some which are not.    is a polynomial, of degree 3, because all of the exponents are whole numbers.   is not a polynomial, because of the exponent of .   is not a polynomial, because it has the square root of .   is not a polynomial, because there is an in the denominator.   is a polynomial, intuitively because if you were to expand out all of the brackets, all of the powers of would be whole numbers.   Notice that all of the non-examples of polynomials either:   Don't have a domain which is all real numbers (they are undefined for some values of ), or,  Are not smooth (they have sharp corners) or not continuous (they have breaks).    Polynomials also have special names based on their degree.   Polynomials of degree 2 are called quadratic (which you've already learned before).  Polynomials of degree 3 are called cubic .  Degree 4 is quartic .  Degree 5 is quintic .  Degree 6 is sextic or hexic .   You can always just say degree 3 polynomial or degree 4 polynomial , but you should be aware of these terms. Typically, the higher the degree of the polynomial, the more complicated it is.    Turning Points of a Polynomial  A polynomial can have multiple points where it turns around , going from increasing to decreasing, or decreasing to increasing.   A linear function ( ) has 0 turning points (it never bends).  Quadratic ( ) has 1 turning point (the vertex).  Cubic ( ) has up to 2 turning points.  Quartic ( ) has up to 3 turning points.   It turns out that in general, a polynomial of degree can have at most turning points.    End Behavior of a Polynomial  As we've seen, the graph of a polynomial function can go either up or down on the left and right side, depending on its equation. This is called it's end behavior .   The end behavior of a function is its behavior as becomes large in either the positive or negative direction.   Graphically, end behavior is what the function does to the far right or far left side of the graph. The graph of a polynomial function may increase in some places and decrease in others, however it will eventually tend towards either going up or down .   Sometimes polynomial functions go right and up, sometimes they go right and down,  Sometimes they go left and up, and other times left and down.   The end behavior of a polynomial function is determined by the leading term. Intuitively, this is because when is large (either large positive, or large negative), the leading term dominates the other terms, in the sense that it's size is much bigger than the others. All other terms become insignificant in size.  In particular, the end behavior of a polynomial depends on both:   Its degree , being even or odd.  Its leading coefficient , being positive or negative.   It can be summarized in this table:    End behavior table     Some observations:   Even-degree polynomials have the same end behavior on each side.  Odd-degree polynomials have opposite end behavior.   Also,   For even-degree polynomials, the leading coefficient determines if it opens up or opens down (similar to a parabola).  For odd-degree polynomials, the sign of the leading coefficient determines the overall trend, if it overall has positive slope (like ) or negative slope (like ), (similar to a line).   There are a few ways to describe end behavior:   The simplest is just to draw that little sketch of how the arrows will go on the left side and the right side.   Another way is through the quadrants, which looks like this:  End behavior table      Remember that the quadrants are labelled starting from the top right, and going counterclockwise, like this:          y-Intercept of a Polynomial  Recall that the -intercept for linear and quadratic functions is simply the constant term,   This is because to find the -intercept, set , and solve for . Doing this makes all of the terms vanish, leaving only the constant term left. In general, the -intercept of a polynomial function is the constant term.   y-intercept Example  For , the -intercept is .     x-Intercepts (Zeros) of a Polynomial  For -intercepts, first note that the terms zero , root , and -intercept are all somewhat used interchangably. Zero and root are more truly synonyms, whereas -intercept typically refers to the point on the graph (where it touches the -axis).   A number is a zero or ( root ) of if . The following are equivalent:    is a zero of .   is a root of .   is an -intercept of the graph of .    Recall that to find -intercepts, you set , and solve for .   Finding x-intercepts  For , we get,   and we need to solve for . It is not obvious how to do this at first glance.   In general, the -intercept(s) of a polynomial function are the solutions to the equation .  We will explore various techniques to solve equations like this. Most of the examples will be simple, with numbers chosen very carefully so that the problem is solvable. In general, solving this equation by hand and exactly is very difficult, and sometimes actually impossible (and only possible approximately).   "

  "body": " Polynomial Zeros, Factored Form   Recall that a big part of analyzing quadratic functions was to be able to find their zeros, i.e. to solve quadratic equations. In a similar way, we want to find zeros of higher-degree polynomial functions.  However, this is not as easy. In fact, it is not even possible to do exactly in general for any given polynomial.  Recall that for quadratic equations, there are 3 main techniques:   Using technology (graphing).  Factoring.  Quadratic formula.   Unfortunately, there is no easy formula (similar to the quadratic formula) that can solve 3rd degree, 4th degree, or higher degree equations. This means that we will have to use factoring (by hand) or technology.    Zeros by Technology\/Graphing Calculator\/Desmos  The easiest way to find the zeros of a polynomial function is using technology. Graph the function using Desmos , and observe the -intercepts, which are the zeros.  However, you may not get the zeros in exact form, depending on if they are integers, fractions, or irrational numbers.    Solving Polynomial Equations in Factored Form  Recall that many quadratic equations were solved by factoring them and setting each factor equal to zero. If the quadratic in factored form, then finding its zeros is straightforward.   Solving a Factored Quadratic  For example,   We set each factor equal to zero:   So the solutions are and . Or, you might just read off the solutions from the equation itself.   You might recall that this is called the zero product property , which says that if the product of two numbers is 0, then one of the numbers must be equal to 0. In othre words, for 2 numbers and , if , then or . This is the fundamental property used to solve quadratic equations by factoring.  This idea generalizes to higher degree polynomials, with more than 2 terms.   Solving a Factored Cubic Polynomial  For example, consider this polynomial with 3 factors,   It is cubic, because it has 3 linear factors. If you were to expand it out, the highest power would be . To find the zeros, set :   Then each factor can be set to zero:   Solving gives:   Thus, the solutions are .    Solving a Factored Quartic Polynomial  Similarly, for this degree 4 (quartic) polynomial equation,   Setting each factor equal to zero gives:   Solving gives:     Factors Not in Standard Form  Sometimes the factors might not be written in the standard form. For example,   Setting each factor equal to zero:   Solving gives:   The solutions are .    Factors with Multiplicity  The exponents on the factors can also vary. For example,   However, it doesn't change the strategy. Set each factor to zero, giving,   And solve for ,   So the zeros are and .   In general, if you have a bunch of factors multiplied together that equals 0, then each of the factors can be 0. In this way, solving polynomial equations in this form is easy.   Zero product property  If the product of any number of factors is equal to zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero.   A polynomial written as a product of its factors is said to be in factored form .

You can use this to at least check your work, or help you out if you're stuck. This is similar to how it can calculate the zeros of a quadratic function .   Press MODE , and go to equation mode by pressing EQN . A menu will appear which shows the various equation types. Press 4 to choose the cubic equation option .  The calculator will show entry fields for , , , and . Enter each coefficient in order, pressing = after each one. After entering all coefficients, press = to compute the solutions.  The calculator will display the first root (e.g., followed by the value). Use the up\/down arrow keys to scroll through the roots.

Check for common factors. If there are any common factors, either a variable, number, or both. If so, factor out the greatest common factor (GCF).   e.g. .  e.g. .  If the leading coefficient is negative, factor out from all its terms.  Especially check if the numbers in the equation are big!     Find one factor, by testing potential zeros until you find a zero. If is a zero, then is a factor (factor theorem).   Can find zeros using your scientific calculator (if allowed) with TABLE mode.   List all of the potential roots to show your work (if required).   If the leading coefficient is 1, then all potential integer roots are the factors of the constant term (integral zero theorem).   If the leading coefficient is not 1, then the possible roots are all fractions of the form , where:   is a factor of the constant term  is a factor of the leading coefficient   (rational root theorem)     Divide out the factor, using synthetic division, so that the resulting polynomial has a degree 1 lower than originally.  Repeat the steps, until the resulting polynomial is quadratic.  Factor the quadratic. If it's not factorable, use the quadratic formula to check for potential irrational zeros.   Note: Also keep in mind other special factoring patterns, which can sometimes be used instead of synthetic division:    Difference of squares, sum of cubes, difference of cubes.    Quadratic form (e.g. or ).  Factor by grouping.   Some remarks:   The order you find the factors doesn't really matter, in that any order will eventually lead you to the same final factored form. However, if testing zeros, it is often easier and more systematic to start from the simplest and smallest zeros, like 1 or , maybe 2 or , etc.  If you test a number and it is a root, it can still be a root again for the reduced polynomial (if it is a repeated root). On the other hand, if you test it and it's not a root, then it is guaranteed to be not a root for the reduced polynomial, so you can skip it.  With multiple synthetic division steps, you can stack multiple of them together, for conciseness.

  "body": " Applications of Polynomial Functions   Box Problem (Open-Top Box)  The box problem is a classic word problem in the polynomial functions chapter. The setup is complicated at first, but after you understand it, each problem goes pretty much the same way.   Open-Top Box from Cardboard   We are going to design a box with an open-top in the following way.    Start with a flat sheet of cardboard, of size 24 cm by 18 cm (the size varies for each question).    Cut out 4 square corners of equal size from the sheet.    Fold the 4 flaps of the sheets up, which forms the sides of the box (we tape together the sides).    The non-folded up part forms the base of the box.    It looks like this,        This creates a box, with an open top. If we cut out different lengths for the corner, the resulting box will have a different shape, and a different volume. Check out this Geogebra applet: Volume of a box problem . The is how much is cut from each corner (or the cut size). Then, the volume is a function of the cut size.     Find an expression for the volume of the box, as a function of the cut size. Find the domain of the problem.    First, the volume of a box is (length width height). If the cut size is , then the dimensions look like this,       The length is (because it is the starting amount of 24 cm, with cut off on both sides.    The width is (similarly).    The height is (because the cut size is the height of the flaps, which becomes the height of the box when folded up).    Therefore, the volume is,   Here is a graph of that function: Desmos graph . The cut size is on the horizontal axis, and the resulting volume is on the vertical axis.  For the domain, this function requires that is at most 9, because you can only cut off at most half of the width (18) from each side. Otherwise, you're cutting off the entire box (and more), which doesn't make sense. Also, of course, you must cut at least something off. Together, we have . If or , then the box has 0 volume. Some teachers might include these in the domain, as , for convenience.      Find the cut size(s), and the dimensions of the box, that produces a box with volume of .    To find when the volume is 560 cm , we set and solve for ,   Graphically, the solution(s) are the intersections of and the horizontal line ( Desmos link ). Observe that the intersections are at and . This means that both a cut size of 2 cm and 5 cm will produce a box with volume 560 cm .  Without a graphing calculator, we can solve the equation algebraically. First, expand and simplify,   Then, move all terms to one side, and write in standard form,   To make the equation simpler, divide out the common factor of 4,   To solve this, you can use:    The scientific calculator method, either using the cubic equation solver, or the table method.

  "body": " Open-Top Box from Cardboard   We are going to design a box with an open-top in the following way.    Start with a flat sheet of cardboard, of size 24 cm by 18 cm (the size varies for each question).    Cut out 4 square corners of equal size from the sheet.    Fold the 4 flaps of the sheets up, which forms the sides of the box (we tape together the sides).    The non-folded up part forms the base of the box.    It looks like this,        This creates a box, with an open top. If we cut out different lengths for the corner, the resulting box will have a different shape, and a different volume. Check out this Geogebra applet: Volume of a box problem . The is how much is cut from each corner (or the cut size). Then, the volume is a function of the cut size.     Find an expression for the volume of the box, as a function of the cut size. Find the domain of the problem.    First, the volume of a box is (length width height). If the cut size is , then the dimensions look like this,       The length is (because it is the starting amount of 24 cm, with cut off on both sides.    The width is (similarly).    The height is (because the cut size is the height of the flaps, which becomes the height of the box when folded up).    Therefore, the volume is,   Here is a graph of that function: Desmos graph . The cut size is on the horizontal axis, and the resulting volume is on the vertical axis.  For the domain, this function requires that is at most 9, because you can only cut off at most half of the width (18) from each side. Otherwise, you're cutting off the entire box (and more), which doesn't make sense. Also, of course, you must cut at least something off. Together, we have . If or , then the box has 0 volume. Some teachers might include these in the domain, as , for convenience.      Find the cut size(s), and the dimensions of the box, that produces a box with volume of .    To find when the volume is 560 cm , we set and solve for ,   Graphically, the solution(s) are the intersections of and the horizontal line ( Desmos link ). Observe that the intersections are at and . This means that both a cut size of 2 cm and 5 cm will produce a box with volume 560 cm .  Without a graphing calculator, we can solve the equation algebraically. First, expand and simplify,   Then, move all terms to one side, and write in standard form,   To make the equation simpler, divide out the common factor of 4,   To solve this, you can use:    The scientific calculator method, either using the cubic equation solver, or the table method.

  "title": "Interval Notation",
  "body": " Interval Notation   In mathematics, we often work with ranges of numbers. A interval is a range of numbers between two points.  Mathematicians developed a notation to write intervals of numbers concisely and clearly. An interval is made up of:   Two numbers , that represent the start and end of the interval.  Round brackets or square brackets , that indicate if the numbers at the start or end are included or not.    For example,   means all numbers between 3 and 7, including both 3 and 7.     means all numbers between 3 and 7, but not including 3 nor 7.       The type of bracket tells you if the endpoint is included or not:   Square brackets indicate the endpoint is included.  Round brackets (or parentheses ) indicate the endpoint is not included (i.e. is excluded ).    For example,   means all the numbers from to 4, including but not including 4.     means all the numbers from to 4, not including but including 4.       Some intervals have no maximum value, no minimum value, or both. For an interval which has no endpoint, we say that it extends to infinity, and use as the endpoint. We use round brackets for or , since is not a real number, so they are not numbers we can include or reach in our interval.   For example,   For all the numbers greater than 4, not including 4 , we write .     For all the numbers less than or equal to 5 , we write .     For all numbers , we write .         Summary of Interval Notation  In summary,            (the entire real line)    In short, an interval is a shorthand notation for describing all numbers between two endpoints.   Put the smaller number first, and the bigger number second.  Use square brackets when the endpoint is included.  Use round brackets when the endpoint is not included, including for or .   Note that the notation for an interval is the same as a point in the -plane . This is an overloading of notation, however in most cases, the context should make clear which one it's referring to.   "

  "title": "Domain and Range of Functions",
  "body": " Domain and Range of Functions   When working with functions, we need to understand what inputs are allowed and what outputs are possible. The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (typically -values), and the range is the set of all possible output values (typically -values or -values).  Think of a function as a machine: the domain is all the items you're allowed to put into the machine, and the range is all the possible items that can come out of the machine.   Domain and Range   For a function :   The domain of is the set of all possible input values:  The range of is the set of all possible output values:     We will use interval notation to express domains and ranges. Recall from the previous section that interval notation provides a concise way to describe sets of numbers.    Finding the Domain of a Function  To find the domain of a function, we need to identify which values of make the function undefined. The most common restrictions are:   Division by zero: We cannot divide by zero, so any value that makes a denominator equal to zero must be excluded from the domain.  Even roots of negative numbers: We cannot take the square root (or any even root) of a negative number in the real number system, so the expression under an even root must be non-negative.  Logarithms of non-positive numbers: We can only take logarithms of positive numbers (covered in a later chapter).   Let's look at examples of finding domains for different types of functions.   Domain of Polynomial Functions   Find the domain of .    Polynomial functions have no restrictions. We can substitute any real number for and get a valid output.  Therefore, the domain is or (all real numbers).     Domain of Another Polynomial   Find the domain of .    Again, this is a polynomial function with no restrictions.  Domain:     Domain of a Simple Rational Function   Find the domain of .    This function has a variable in the denominator. We need to find where the denominator equals zero:   The function is undefined when , so we must exclude this value from the domain.  Domain:  In words: all real numbers except 3.     Domain with Two Restrictions   Find the domain of .    First, we factor the denominator:   The denominator equals zero when:   We must exclude both values from the domain.  Domain:  In words: all real numbers except and .     Domain with No Restrictions   Find the domain of .    We check if the denominator can equal zero:   Since is always non-negative for real numbers, is always at least 1. The denominator never equals zero.  Domain:     Domain of a Square Root Function   Find the domain of .    The expression under the square root must be non-negative:   Domain:     Domain of Another Radical Function   Find the domain of .

Finding the Range of a Function  Finding the range of a function is generally more challenging than finding the domain. We need to determine all possible output values. There are several strategies:   For simple functions, analyze the behavior algebraically  For transformed functions, use knowledge of transformations  For complex functions, use graphing or calculus techniques    Range of a Linear Function   Find the range of .    Linear functions (with non-zero slope) take on all real number values. As goes from to , the function values also go from to .  Range:     Range of a Quadratic Function (Opens Up)   Find the range of .    The function has a minimum value at , where .  Since for all real , the function values are never negative.  As gets larger (in either direction), increases without bound.  Range:     Range of a Quadratic Function (Opens Down)   Find the range of .    This is a quadratic function in vertex form with vertex .  Since the coefficient of the squared term is negative ( ), the parabola opens downward.  The maximum value occurs at the vertex: .

Step 2: Check for restrictions:   If there's a denominator, set it equal to zero and solve. Exclude these values.  If there's an even root (square root, 4th root, etc.), set the expression inside greater than or equal to zero and solve.  If there's an odd root (cube root, 5th root, etc.), there are no restrictions from the root.  For logarithms, the argument must be positive (covered in later chapters).   Step 3: Combine all restrictions using interval notation.    Strategies for Finding Range  For linear functions: The range is all real numbers (unless it's a horizontal line).  For quadratic functions: Find the vertex. If the parabola opens up, the range is where is the -coordinate of the vertex. If it opens down, the range is .  For rational functions of the form : The range is all real numbers except .  For square root functions of the form :   If , the range is  If , the range is   General strategy: Think about the minimum and maximum values the function can achieve, either through algebra, graphing, or calculus techniques.

Then,      Factor and simplify .  If possible, factor the numerator and denominator.  Determine the domain of the function, which is all real numbers, except the roots of the denominator.  Simplify by cancelling any common factors.     Find any holes . Cancelled factors of the form will result in a hole at , and the -coordinate of these holes will come from evaluating the simplified function at .  Find properties of the function:   Find the y-intercept (if it exists) . The -intercept comes from substituting (i.e. finding ) (as long as 0 is in the domain of ).  Find any x-intercepts . Any -intercepts of are zeros of the numerator.  Find any vertical asymptotes . Any vertical asymptotes are from the zeros of the denominator.    Find the horizontal asymptote (or oblique asymptote) . Compare the degree of the numerator and the denominator.  If , then the line (the -axis) is the horizontal asymptote.  If , then the line , the ratio of the leading coefficients, is the horizontal asymptote.   If , then there is no horizontal asymptote.  If , then there is an oblique (slant) asymptote. Find it using synthetic division or long division.          Plot additional points , if necessary. A good guideline is to have at least 1 point on each side of each vertical asymptote. Two points can be better if you need more detail.  Sketch the graph by connecting the points. The graph should get closer and closer to each asymptote. Be sure to not cross any vertical asymptote.      Examples   Graphing Rational Functions 1   Sketch the graph of each function.

  "body": " Solving Radical Equations   A radical equation is an equation that contains square roots, cube roots, or any radical, with a variable inside it.  To solve equations with square roots, the key technique is to square both sides of the equation. Squaring and square rooting are basically inverse operations, so squaring can be used to undo or cancel out a square root.   Solving a Basic Radical Equation  Consider . Intuitively, we need to isolate , which is currently trapped inside of the square root. To get it out, we first square both sides of the equation, which cancels the square root,   Then, we can solve the equation just like a regular basic equation, by isolating for ,     An Equation with No Solution  Solve . Notice that the right hand side is negative. On the other hand, the left hand side is a square root, which is never negative. So this equation can never be true. We can conclude immediately that there is no solution, without any squaring or other algebra steps.  If you did square both sides, you would get,   which appears to be a solution, but in fact, it will be extraneous.    In general, if you have,   you can stop right away, and conclude there is no solution. Any solution that comes from squaring the equation will always be extraneous.    Solving Basic Square Root Equations   Isolate the radical (if necessary).  Square both sides of the equation (to cancel out the square root).  Solve the equation.

This can happen because squaring an equation can introduce new solutions. For example,     is false, but after squaring, we get , which is true.    Consider the (very simple) equation . This has one (true) solution which is (because replacing with 2 gives , which is true). However, if you square both sides, you get , which has 2 solutions ( and ).    Basically, squaring gets rid of negative signs, which can lead to more solutions.   These solutions, which appear when solving algebraically, but don't actually satisfy the original equation, are called extraneous solutions. Intuitively, extraneous means extra .  In general, for radical equations, you need to check your answers to see if they satisfy the original equation. And this is basically because squaring an equation can lead to an equation with another solution that isn't a solution of the original equation.

Simplify, and solve the resulting equation. If the equation still contains a square root, repeat the previous steps (isolate, square, simplify).

What is similar or the same?      Desmos Exploration  Here is a Desmos graph that allows you to graph , where you can use the slider to change the value of : Exponential Functions .    How does the graph change, based on your choice of ?     In general, for a function like , each time increases by 1, the output is multiplied by the base .    If , the -values increase .    If , the -values decrease .    Also,    The -intercept is always , because when , the -value is .    There are no -intercepts, because is never equal to 0.    The domain is all real numbers, because you can raise a base to any exponent you want, positive or negative.    The range is all positive numbers, or , because raising a number to the exponent always gives a positive output (even if is negative).    Also, notice that all of the functions flatten out around the -axis. We call this a horizontal asymptote . So, the graph has a horizontal asymptote of the -axis, or the line .    Exponential Functions    An exponential function with base is given by,      Examples  Some exponential functions include:                     Non-examples   Non-examples . Some functions that are not exponential functions include:    ( is not an exponent, this is a polynomial function)    (the base must be positive)    (the base cannot be )    (the base is not a constant)    In particular, note that a power function, of the form , is not an exponential function.    With a power function, the base is the variable , and the exponent is a constant .    For exponential functions, the base is a constant , and the exponent is a variable .     For the exponential function , its graph looks like an increasing or decreasing curve with a horizontal asymptote.    -intercept is .    No -intercepts.    Horizontal asymptote is .    Domain is all real numbers, or .    Range is all positive real numbers, or , or .    The base is called the growth factor , because it is the number you multiply to see how the function changes.    If , it is increasing . We call this exponential growth .    If , it is decreasing . We call this exponential decay .       In summary,    Create a table of values for , and plot the points.    Connect the points with a smooth curve.     For an exponential function, it is only approached on one side, so you might call it a half horizontal asymptote.   An exponential graph approaches the horizontal asymptote only on one side        Exponential functions have no vertical asymptotes, because the domain of an exponential function is all real numbers.    Which functions are exponential?    no     yes     no     yes     Determine whether each graph represents an exponential function   If exponential, say whether it is increasing or decreasing.

Desmos Exploration  This Desmos activity lets you explore the exponential function : Exponential Function of the form .    The slider controls the -intercept (or the starting value).    The slider controls the growth factor (how fast the function grows or decays).      Exponential functions , all with the same -intercept , but with different growth factors       Sketching Exponential Functions   Sketch the graph of each exponential function, using its -intercept and 1 more point. State the -intercept, increasing\/decreasing, domain, and range.     -intercept , increasing, domain , range     -intercept , increasing, domain , range     -intercept , decreasing, domain , range     -intercept , decreasing, domain , range      Solving Exponential Equations (Numerically)   Trial-and-error : A basic method is to approximate the solution using trial and error. Choose an initial guess for the solution and plug it in, and see if it equals the other side. Then, adjust your solution up or down, depending on if your output is too high or low.   Solve each equation by trial and error   Round answers to 1 decimal place.                    This method really only works for simple equations.   Graphically : Another method is to solve graphically (just like any other type of equation). Graph each side of the equation, and the solution is the point where they intersect. You can do this using Desmos, or a graphing calculator like the TI-84 Plus CE. In particular, the solution is the -coordinate of the intersection point.   Solving Graphically  To solve graphically, graph and on the same graph: Graph of and . The intersection point is about , which is the answer.   In general, to solve , plot and , and find the -value where they intersect,     For more about solving graphically, see Solving Equations Graphically .   Solving by scientific calculator .

  "body": " Intro to Exponential Growth and Decay   Exponential functions can be used to model amounts that change over time.   Population Growth  A small town has a population of 12000 people. Each year, the population increases by 10%.    What will be the population of the town after 1 year? 2 years? 3 years?    What will be the population after years?     Increase by 10% means that it keeps all of the population it has, and adds 10% more of that number.    100% of the population is the amount it already has    10% more means you are at 110% of the original.    As a decimal, . So, increase by 10% means multiply by 1.10.    At the start (year 0), the population is 12000.    After 1 year, the population is people.    After 2 years, the population is people.    After 3 years, the population is people.    Notice the pattern, which is that we multiply the initial population of 12000 by 1.10 for each year.  In general, after years, we are multiplying by 1.10 precisely times. So, the general formula for population, we'll call it , is given by,     Smartphone Depreciation  Suppose you buy a new smartphone for $1400. Each year, its value drops by 35%.    How much will it be worth after 1 year? 2 years? 3 years?    How much will it be worth after years?     Drop by 35% means you keep 65% of the value each year, because you start with 100% of its value, take away 35%, and are left with 65%. As a decimal, , so decreasing by 35% each year means multiply by 0.65 each year.   In general,    In general, exponential change has this form,     Exponential Growth and Decay Models  The exponential growth and exponential decay models are given by,   The base is called the growth factor , because it controls how the amount changes from one step to the next.  It can also be thought of in terms of the percentage change, as ,   Here, represents the percentage change (as a decimal),    If , then it is exponential growth , and is the growth rate .    If , then it is exponential decay , and is the decay rate .    In simple terms,   Exponential functions have applications for,    Population growth (biology), of animals, people, or bacteria.    Growth of an investment (economics)    Decay of a radioactive substance (chemistry)    In general, anything that changes by a percentage can be modelled by exponential functions.   Finding Growth Factors   Find the growth factor required for each percentage change.    28% increase  1.28    13% decrease  0.87    55% decrease  0.45    72% increase  1.72    6% increase  1.06    0.24% increase  1.0024      Examples   Bacteria Population Growth   A microbiologist cultures a type of bacteria in a petri dish.

Estimate how long it will take for the bacteria population to reach 200 million, using a graphing calculator, or guess and test.  hours    What is the domain and range of the function in this context?  Domain is , range is .     Insect Colony Population Growth   An ecologist monitors a colony of insects in a controlled habitat. The population (in thousands of insects) after days is modeled by .    What is the initial insect population?  thousand insects    What is the growth rate per day?  22% per day    Find the insect population after 4 days.  thousand insects    Find the insect population after 8 days.  thousand insects    Sketch a graph of the insect population over time using the previous parts.

Estimate how long it will take for the insect population to reach 80 thousand insects, using a graphing calculator, or guess and test.  days     Coffee and Caffeine   A cup of coffee contains 160 mg of caffeine. Caffeine in the body decreases with exponential decay, where the amount of caffeine in the body decreases by 13% per hour.    Write an equation that gives the amount of caffeine after hours of drinking a cup of coffee.     How much caffeine remains in the body after 2 hours? After 5 hours?  mg and mg    Research shows that by bedtime, you should have at most 30 mg of caffeine in your body (to avoid it negatively affecting your sleep quality). How long will it take to reach 30 mg?  hours    Suppose that instead, you drink 2 cups of coffee. Estimate how long it will take for your body to have only 30 mg left, using a graphing calculator or guess and test.  hours     Flu Virus Spreading   A flu virus spreads in a school. The number of people infected after days is given by .    What is the initial number of people infected?     What is the growth rate of people infected per day?  33.2%    Find the number of people who were infected after 16 days.  people    There are 1200 people in the school. Estimate the time it will take for everybody in the school to catch the flu, using a graphing calculator, or guess and test.  days     Depreciation of a Car   A car was purchased for $15,500. The car decreases in value by 15% each year.    Write an equation that would give the value of the car years after it was purchased.     How many years would the car be worth one quarter of its original value?  , find when  years    How many years would it take the car to be worth $2500?  , find when  years     Availability of Light Under Water   As a scuba diver, the deeper you dive, the less light available to you (because the more light is absorbed by the water above you). Suppose that the amount of light available decreases by 12% for every 10 m that you descend.    Write the exponential function that relates the amount, , as a percent expressed as a decimal, of light available to the depth, , in 10-m increments.  Each 10 m multiplies the light by , and     Sketch a graph of the function.  The graph is a decreasing exponential curve, with a -intercept of 1.    What are the domain and range of the function in this context?  Domain is , range is .    What percent of light will reach you if you dive to a depth of 25 m?  25 m is increments of 10 m, so  , so about 73% of the surface light      Compound Interest  Another application of exponential growth is compound interest , where your interest also earns interest.  When a bank pays interest, it adds some money to your account. If you leave that interest in the account, then the next time interest is calculated, it’s calculated on a bigger amount than before. So the amount grows faster over time because it’s not just the original money earning interest, but the added interest also starts earning interest. This is precisely exponential growth.   Suppose that you deposit $2500 and your account earns 4% per year. After 1 year, the bank will pay you,   This means that after 1 year, your new total is,   Just like other examples of exponential growth, we can think of adding this interest like a growth factor. In this case, it is , because to increase by 4% each year, we have to multiply by 1.04. Then, the amount of money after years is given by,    In general,    Compound Interest Calculation  You deposit $2450 into a savings account that earns 3.2% interest per year, compounded annually. Write an equation for the amount after years, and find the amount after 4 years.

Solving Exponential Equations Using Common Bases  Some simple exponential equations can be solved by using the intuitive fact that if two powers with the same base are equal, then their exponents must be equal. In other words,   This means that if we can write both sides of an exponential equation as a power of the same base, then we can set their exponents equal ( equate exponents ), resulting in a simpler equation that we can solve.    Rewrite both sides using a common base.    Simplify using exponent laws.    Set the exponents equal.    Solve the resulting equation.    The resulting equation could be linear, quadratic, or some other type of equation.  Sometimes, both sides can be written as a power of multiple numbers, which result in the same solution.

  "body": " Intro to Logarithms   Logarithms are a kind of inverse of exponents.   Motivation for Logs with Base 10  Consider these powers of 10, These tell you that 10 to an exponent gives a number. Now reverse the question. Instead of asking what equals, ask: 10 to what power equals 1000? Since , the answer is 3.  Logarithms are a shorthand for this reverse question. The expression (read this as log base 10 of ) means the exponent you put on 10 to get . Intuitively, is the number of 10s you need to multiply together in order to get . So, for example, In other words,  Powers convert exponents to numbers  Logs convert numbers to exponent .  In this way, logarithms are a kind of inverse of exponents.    Approximating Logarithms  We know that for the equation , the answer is , because . However, what about the equation ?  We know that and , so we expect the solution to be between 3 and 4. Maybe a better guess is in the middle, like . Here, , which is a bit more than 11. Try , and we get , which is a bit less than 11. So, the solution is between 3.4 and 3.5.  Using logarithms, we can say that the exact answer is (read this as log base 2 of 11 ), which means the exponent you must put on 2 to get 11. It turns out that .  You can try this on your calculator. You'll see that , which is very, very close to 11.    Logarithm Examples  Similarly,  , because .  , because .  , because       Logarithms  The logarithm base b of a , denoted by , is the exponent that must be raised to, to get . In other words,      The equations ( logarithmic form ) and ( exponential form ) are two ways of expressing the same relationship between the numbers , and .  With the logarithmic form ,  is called the base of the logarithm.  is called the argument (the value inputted into the function).  is the logarithm (since it equals the logarithmic expression).  With the exponential form ,  is also the base .  is the exponent .  is the result of the power.  Notice that the exponent is equivalent to the logarithm above (since logarithms are an exponent), and that the result is equivalent to the argument above.   Converting Forms  Convert each logarithmic or exponential equation to exponential or logarithmic form.                                       Logarithms are a name for a certain exponent. In particular, is the exponent to which must be raised, to obtain .  When you see , mentally translate into the exponent you'd put on the base to get what's inside .   Evaluating Basic Logarithms  Evaluate each logarithm.    2     5     2     4     4     2     5     6     4     6      Logarithm Bases  The two most commonly-used logarithm bases are:  Base 10, denoted by , called the common logarithm , which is used in many applied sciences.  Base , called the natural logarithm , which is often used in calculus.  These are often denoted by simply and , respectively. In other words, These two logarithms are included on most calculators. The natural logarithm is denoted by because it is an abbreviation of the Latin term logarithmus naturali .   In computer science, often log base 2 is used, or .    For logarithms, we use three letters to denote the common logarithm, and two letters to denote the natural logarithm.  Typically, functions have been represented by a single letter, such that for or for .  In this way, or represents a function just like does. However, we often write logarithms without parentheses as or .  If you have seen the trig functions like or , then is a similar kind of notation: means the log function with as its input, just like means the sine function with as its input. In particular, does not mean times 10 , just like doesn't mean times 30 .  If a log contains more than one term, then we use brackets. For example, . Or, if there are a lot of factors, e.g. .     Basic Properties of Logarithms   Logarithm of the Base  Consider . This means the exponent to put on 5 to get 5. This is 1, since . Similarly         Logarithm of the base   Because, the exponent you need to put on to get is 1.    Logarithm of One  Consider . This means the exponent to put on 3 to get 1. This is 0, because . Similarly,         Logarithm of 1   Because, the exponent you need to put on to get 1 is 0.     Evaluating Logarithms (By Hand)   Evaluating Logarithms  Evaluate each logarithm.        -1     4     -3     -3                                 -2         -4         -3         0     1      Logs of Negative Numbers  It turns out, we can't take the logarithm of a negative number, or 0.   Log of a Negative Number  Consider . This number represents the exponent to put on 2 to get . However, the equation has no solution, because 2 to the power of any number will always result in a positive number, never a negative.    Log of Zero  Consider . This also doesn't work, because has no solution. Again, 2 to the power of any number will always be positive, and so will never equal to 0.   In general, This is because for any base , the expression means the exponent needed to raise to get . Since to the power of any number is always positive, there is only an answer if is positive.    Evaluating Logarithms Using a Calculator  My recommended calculator Casio fx-991ES Plus C 2nd edition (or some other similar scientific calculators, as well as the TI-84 Plus CE) can calculate logarithms of any base.  However, many older and weaker calculators only have buttons for:  Base 10 (common logarithms) denoted by the key  Natural logarithms (base ) denoted by  In fact, base 10 logs are enough to evaluate logs of any base, because of this rule, This allows us to change a log of any base ( ) to something involving logs base 10. It also works for natural logarithms, but you can just stick with logs base 10.   Change-of-base property     Using Change of Base  For example,   (we could have found this one without a calculator)     This equality is a particular case of what is called the change-of-base property, which we'll explore further later on.    Inverse Properties of Logarithms   Logarithm of a Power  Consider . This means the exponent that 3 must be raised, to get . The answer is 5, because literally, 3 to the 5 is 3 to the 5. Similarly,        In general, if you take the log of a power of the base, the answer is the exponent.   Logarithm of a power of the base   Intuitively, is the exponent to put on to get , which is literally .    Power of a Logarithm  Consider . The exponent of represents the exponent to put on 4 to get 11. We are taking 4 to the power of this number, so by definition, we should get 11. Therefore, .  Similarly,         Power of a logarithm with the same base   Intuitively, is the exponent which must be raised to get . So, if we raise to that exponent, we get (literally) .    Evaluating with Inverse Properties  Evaluate each expression.    5     9     8     17     3     19     5     25                  Solving Basic Logarithmic Equations (Finding the Unknown)  To solve for an unknown that involves logs, the main technique is to convert to exponential form.   Solving Equations  Solve each equation.                                                                           In the next examples, if there are multiple logs inside each other, then work from the outside in. Convert to exponential form to unwrap one layer.

  "title": "Carbon Dating and Half-Life",
  "body": " Carbon Dating and Half-Life    Application: Carbon Dating   Carbon dating is a method for estimating how long ago a living thing died. Using it, we can estimate how long ago animals like mammoths lived, or ancient humans, without having actual records of them.   All living things contain carbon, and there are different types of carbon.    One is called carbon-12 , which is the normal type of carbon.    Another is carbon-14 , which is a radioactive type of carbon (called an isotope), which decays over time into a different element.    When a plant or animal is alive, it always has roughly the same amount of carbon-14. However, when it dies, it stops taking in new carbon-14 (or any carbon at all). Over time, its amount of carbon-14 decreases. It turns out that it decreases exponentially.  To measure the rate of exponential decay, instead of using a percentage, we use its half-life , which is the time it takes for the amount to decay to half its initial amount.  Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5730 years. This means that:    After 5730 years, half of the carbon-14 is gone.    After another 5730 years, half of what's left is gone (so 25% of the initial amount is left).    Then half again, and again, and so on.    This means if we start with 100% of the carbon-14, then the percent of carbon-14 remaining after years is given by,     The growth factor is because we want to multiply the amount by    represents the number of half-lives in years. For example, if , that is half-lives.    The idea behind carbon dating is that if we measure how much carbon-14 the dead organism has, and also know how much it had when alive, we can estimate how long the carbon-14 has been decaying for, and therefore how long ago it died.     Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5730 years. Find the approximate age of a dead organism that has 20% of its original carbon-14 in its tissues.    , find when    Approximately 13308 years     Carbon dating works for organisms that are up to about 60000 years old, as anything older than that has too little carbon-14 to measure. It was developed in 1949 by Willard Libby (1908-1980), American chemist, and it revolutionized archaeology and paleontology.     Application: Radioactive Decay  Many elements have radioactive isotopes , which are versions of the element which are radioactive. These radioactive isotopes decay over time into regular, non-radioactive elements. They decay continuously at a constant percentage, and so they can be modelled using exponential decay.  The half-life of a substance is the time required for a decaying amount to decay to half its initial amount.   Half-life is analogous to doubling time for exponential growth.      represents the growth factor (or decay factor, since it is exponential decay).    represents the number of times that factor is applied (in other words, the number of half-lives in time ).     If a radioactive substance starts with 100g, after 1 half-life it will decay to 50g. After another half-life, that 50g will decay to 25g (half of 50g), and so on.    # of half-lives  Amount (g)    0  100    1  50    2  25    3  12.5    4  6.25    5  3.125    6  1.5625       How many half-lives does it take for a radioactive sample to decay to 12.5% of its original element?    3 half-lives      After 40 years, an original sample of 100 kg has decayed to 25 kg. What is this material's half-life?    to go from 100 kg to 25 kg, that is 2 half-lives    20 years      Americium (Am) is a radioactive element that is used in household smoke detectors. Am-241 has a half-life of approximately 432 years. The average smoke detector contains 0.28 of Am-241. Find an equation for the amount of Am-241 in a smoke detector after years.         Radioactive argon-39 has a half-life of 275 years. If we initially have 84 grams of argon-39, how much remains after 1600 years?    Use , and    Approximately 1.49 grams      Radioactive phosphorus-32 is used to study liver function. It has a half-life of 14.3 days. If a small amount of phosphorus-32 is injected into a person’s body, find how long it will take for the level of radiation to drop to 5% of its original value.    , find when    days     How long would it take 70% of a radioactive substance to decay if its half-life was 20 hours?    , find when    hours     A radioactive substance is produced from nuclear fallout. If 300 g of this substance decays to 120 g in 30 years, what is the half-life of this substance?    , and when , , and solve for    years     The half-life of an element is 15.9 hours. A medical clinic purchases a 50 gram sample of this element. How long until there would be only 12.5 grams left? Solve without using logs.    50g to 12.5g is 2 half-lives    31.8 hours      An element has a half-life of 30 days. How long would it take until 20% of the original amount remained?    , find when    days     A radioactive sample with an initial mass of 72 mg has a half-life of 10 days.     Write a function to relate the amount remaining, , in milligrams, to the time, , in days.         What amount of the radioactive sample will remain after 20 days?    About 18 mg      What amount of the radioactive sample was there 30 days ago?    About 576 mg      How long, to the nearest day, will it take for there to be 0.07 mg of the initial sample remaining?    days     "

  "title": "Radian Measure",
  "body": " Radian Measure   There is another unit for measuring angles, called radian , which turns out to be more useful than degrees, particularly in calculus.    Radians are a unit of angles such that,     In other words,   radians is a half-rotation.  radians is a full rotation.       The symbol for radians is rad , however the symbol is often omitted. So, if an angle has no unit, it should be assumed to be radians (and for degrees, use ).   The equivalence can be thought of as a conversion factor, a ratio to convert between these two angle units (analogous to how 1 inch = 2.54 cm, or how 1 hour = 60 minutes).    Converting Between Degrees and Radians    Converting between degrees and radians .        Angle Conversion Practice   Convert each angle from degrees to radians or radians to degrees.    to radians    to degrees    to degrees      Sketching Angles in Radians  To graph an angle in radians, it's easiest to think in terms of fractions of . To start, recall that:   is a full rotation ( )  is a half rotation ( )   Then,   (or half of ) is a quarter rotation (half of a half rotation), which is .  (or a quarter of ) is half of a quarter rotation, which is .  is split into 6 equal pieces, which is .  is split into 3 pieces, which is .    Special-angle arcs on the unit circle.                 For bigger angles, we can count multiples of those smaller angles .   Sketching 2pi\/3  For , first divide into 3 equal pieces, and then count 2 of them counterclockwise,       Sketching 5pi\/6  For , first divide into 6 equal pieces, and then count 5 of them (counterclockwise),       Sketching 7pi\/4  For , first divide into 4 equal pieces, and then count 7 of them counterclockwise,       Sketching Practice   Sketch each angle in standard position.               Motivating Radians  Here, we will step back and explore the intuition behind radians, and how they come about to measure angles.   Alternate Angular Units  First, it is helpful to step back and understand the idea of how angles can be measured.  Degrees are a unit of rotation such that 360 degrees make a full rotation. They are useful practical applications (historically, for navigation, architecture, and astronomy), because you can divide 360 evenly into many numbers (like 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, etc.), so many common angles have whole number values (like , etc.).  However, if we were starting from scratch, with no prior knowledge of degrees, we could consider other useful units of measuring angles. For example:   The gradian , where a quarter rotation is defined to be 100 gradians. Then, a full rotation would be 400 gradians.  Or, 1 turn could be defined as a full rotation. Then, a half rotation is turns, or a quarter rotation is turns.  For units inspired by the fact that a pizza has 8 slices, a unit could be called a slice , defined to be th of a full rotation. Then, 8 slices would be a full rotation.  We could define 1 unit to be a quarter rotation. Then, 4 units is a full rotation.   Ultimately, units are a convention, and what units are useful or most natural depends on the context.   With radians, the idea is that we will measure angles based on how long the arc of the angle is.     The longer the arc is, the bigger the angle that is swept out. The amount you rotate is proportional to how far you travel along the circle.   Small rotation small distance traveled  Big rotation big distance traveled      However, just measuring the arc doesn't fully work, because the arc length depends on the size of the circle (basically, it depends on it's radius).   If you have a small circle, you won't have to walk very far to make a full loop.  If you have a big circle, the same angle will mean you walk a lot farther.      We want a measurement which purely measures rotation, that isn't affected by how big the circle is. The key idea is: even though the arc length changes when the circle gets bigger or smaller, it changes in a very predictable way. In particular, arc length is proportional to the radius.   If you double the radius, the arc length doubles .  If you triple the radius, the arc length triples .    Arc Length Proportionality  For example, for this particular angle below, for cm, the arc is 8 cm, and for cm, the arc is 16 cm.     While the arc lengths are different, in both scenarios, the arc length is 2 radius lengths.   To measure arc length, instead of using meters or centimeters or any other unit of length, we use the radius itself as the unit. In other words, we ask:   For example:   If the radius is 4 m, and the arc length is 12 m, that is radius lengths of rotation.  If the radius is 3 m, and the arc length is 15 m, that is radius lengths of rotation.      In other words, to measure the angle, divide the arc length by the radius length.    Radians  In short, radians measure angles based on how long the arc associated with the angle is, in terms of radius lengths.    One radian is defined to be the angle at the center of a circle such that the arc length associated with it is equal to the radius of the circle,     More generally, an angle with associated radius and arc length is given by,      In fancy math language, we often say that the angle  subtends the arc, or the arc is subtended by the angle .  Radians are technically dimensionless , because they are the ratio of two lengths.    "

  "title": "Quadratic Trigonometric Equations",
  "body": " Quadratic Trigonometric Equations   Some trigonometric equations are quadratic in a particular trigonometric function, in that they involve a trigonometric function being squared. In this way, many methods for solving quadratic equations can be used to solve trig equations.    Notation and Other Powers of a Trigonometric Function  Sometimes, we want to write the square of a trig function. For example, , or . It is common to write this more simply as .   Notation Example  For example, means . Then,    This convention saves space and avoids writing so many brackets with expressions that have many powers involving trigonometric functions. This notation applies in general to all trigonometric functions,   This all works the same with higher powers (e.g. ).  This notation often confuses students when first learning it. In particular, the exponent (2 in this case) applies to the entire trigonometric function, not the angle . In other words,   If you like, whenever you see a squared trig function, you can first write it with brackets, before starting with the problem.    Solving Quadratic Trigonometric Equations   Substitution Idea  Consider . To solve this, you can think of replacing with a single variable ( ), to get . To solve this, you would isolate for , and then take the square root of both sides.   More precisely, if is a quadratic equation, then the equation can be put into the form (or another trigonometric function).

General solution: OR or or .    .  Answer: . General solution: OR or or .    Note that you can't divide by (or any other trig function), because that assumes that , when in fact can equal 0. This is just like how with the equation , you can't divide by and instead have to factor it out.    Trigonometric Equations in Quadratic Form  Again, it is helpful to think about the equation if the trig function was replaced by a single variable (say, ).

  "body": " Intro to Trigonometric Identities   In algebra, there are various equations which are always true, called identities.   For example,   These two sides are exactly the same, for any value of and . In other words, it is true no matter what numbers and are. This is called an identity. Another identity is,    We can also consider trigonometric identities , which are trigonometric equations that are true for all values of the variable.  We already know some basic identities, which could almost be called definitions.     Pythagorean Identities  There is also the Pythagorean identity, which comes from the unit circle,   This basically means that if you see in an expression, you can replace it with simply 1.  This identity can also be rearranged, to isolate for either or ,   We can also derive further identities, using this identity,   At first, when you're solving problems, have all of these identities available as a reference. Here is a summary of all common trigonometric identities: Summary of Trigonometric Identities . We will learn the remaining identities in the next few sections. On a test, most instructors will give you a formula sheet with all of the trigonometric identities (similar to my summary). However, with practice, you will naturally remember most of them.

Non-Permissible Values  In algebra, we know that division by zero is undefined. For example, is undefined when . In a similar way, trig expressions can have values where they are undefined.  A non-permissible value is a value of the variable that makes an expression undefined (sometimes, it is also called a restriction ). For trigonometric expressions, this happens whenever a denominator equals zero.   Non-Permissible Values of  Find any non-permissible values of .  Using the quotient identity, . The denominator is , so we set it equal to zero,   This occurs when , or in general, where .  Therefore, the non-permissible values are .   To find non-permissible values, basically:    Convert everything to sine and cosine (using the quotient and reciprocal identities).    Find where each denominator is 0, by setting them equal to zero and solving.    Non-Permissible Values of  Find any non-permissible values of .  First, rewrite in terms of sine and cosine:   Even though we could try to simplify this, the non-permissible values come from the original expression. The expression is undefined when:   is undefined, which is when  itself is undefined when (again).  is in a denominator, so we need , which means .   Then,   Setting gives  Setting gives .   Combined, the non-permissible values are (every multiple of ).    When simplifying trigonometric expressions, always find non-permissible values from the original expression before simplifying. This is because the simplified form might cancel some things out which can't be 0 in the original expression.

Actually, if you write down a random equation with a combination of trig functions, it probably won't be an identity.  A simple way to verify if an equation is an identity is to graph both sides using a graphing calculator, like Desmos .  If an equation is an identity, then both sides of the equation will be equal for all values of the variable, and so the graph of each side will coincide (i.e. overlap each other).   If both graphs overlap completely, the equation is an identity.  On the other hand, if the two graphs don't match at even a single point, then the equation is not an identity.    Verify by Graphing  Verify that using a graphing calculator. Observe how they coincide (overlap): Desmos graph .     Verifying Identities   Verify for a Single Value  Verify for .    Is Checking One Value Enough?  Mark claimed that is an identity. Marcia let and found that both sides of the equation worked out to . She said that this proves that the equation is an identity. Is Marcia's reasoning correct? Explain.  Answer: No. Checking only shows the equality holds at one value, but an identity must hold for all in its domain. However, it is true this is an identity, it's just not proven by checking only one value.    Verify for  Verify for .  Answer: For , both sides are .    "

  "body": " Intro to Proving Trigonometric Identities   We already know a few fundamental trig identities. Using these, we can prove new and more complicated identities.  Proving a trigonometric identity involves manipulating each side of the equation algebraically, to show that both sides of the equation are equivalent.    General Principles for Proving Identities  This topic is often considered one of the most challenging by students, because:   It involves a culmination of a variety of algebra techniques learned over the course of high school math.  It requires some creativity to choose a strategy.  It involves more abstract and symbolic reasoning, with basically no visualizations.   Here are some general principles:    Rewrite everything in terms of sine and cosine . All trigonometric ratios can be written in terms of the basic trig ratios sine and cosine.     The one exception is if the entire identity includes only tangent and\/or cotangent, in which case it is usually simpler to convert everything in terms of tangent.    Start with the more complicated side . In general,   Tangent is more complicated than sine and cosine.  Reciprocal trig functions are more complicated than primary trig functions (sine, cosine, tangent).  Multiple terms are more complicated than a single term.   You want to start with the more complicated side, because it is easier to start from something complex and simplify it, rather than start from something simple and make it more complex.    Begin with the end in mind . Look at the form of the desired side before you start, and guide your work toward that structure. Especially helpful if you are stuck and unsure how to continue.    Here are some particular algebraic tactics:   Combine fractions, using a common denominator.  Simplify complex fractions, by clearing denominators (multiply the numerator and denominator by the LCD).   Use algebraic identities, e.g. difference of squares, square of a sum, etc.   For example,   .  .     Convert to or vice versa, using the Pythagorean identity:     Multiply by the conjugate, in order to use the Pythagorean identity (converting to , or to ). In particular, if the identity includes,    Use all trigonometric identities available to you. When practicing, have a list of them for reference, and you'll naturally be more comfortable with them over time.     Examples   Basic Examples   Prove each trigonometric identity.

  "title": "Sum and Difference Identities",
  "body": " Sum and Difference Identities   The sum identities say that if you know about two angles and , you can also find sine (or cosine, or tangent) of the two angles added together . The difference identities do the same for the difference (subtraction) .   These identities are maybe the most challenging to remember at first, so definitely keep them available when practicing.  The 6 identities can be written more concisely as,   Notice that for cosine and tangent, the left has while the right has a sign, which means that on the left goes with on the right, and on the left goes with on the right.    Finding Exact Values Examples  The sum and difference identities can be used to find trigonometric ratios (like sine, cosine, and tangent) for several angles not typically found on the unit circle (i.e. not just and their multiples).   Find Cosine of  Find . We can calculate this, because is the sum of two special angles (which we know about). Then, the sum identity for cosine says,   This answer is correct, however we can continue to simplify the result into one fraction,   Therefore, .    Find Tangent of  Find . Here, after some trial and error, . Then,   This answer is correct, however we can continue to simplify the result,   This is a solid final answer. However, some instructors will expect that you rationalize the denominator to fully simplify,   Therefore, .   This works for any angle which can be written as the sum of two special angles (or the difference of two special angles). Here are some of the common ones.        Notice that there is often more than one way to write it (but maybe there is one easier way). For example, , but also . Also, in radians,         Evaluate Exact Trigonometric Ratios   Evaluate each trigonometric ratio exactly, and simplify your answer.

Here are pretty much all of them summarized in a table (between and ),   Of course, you shouldn't memorize this table, but it's just to give you an idea of the question style you should expect, and the style of the final answer.   My recommended calculator Casio fx-991ES Plus C 2nd edition (or some other similar scientific calculators) can find exact values of these angles. For example, typing in will output . You can use this to at least check your work.    Exact Values with Variable Angles   Cosine of Variable Angle Sum  Let be in quadrant III with . Find in exact value.  To find , use the sum identity,   We know , , and we are given , but we're also going to need to find .  To do this, sketch the angle in standard position, which is in quadrant III. Since , and .     Then, find , using ,   Since is in quadrant III, must be negative, so . Then, . Then,    In general, use a sum\/difference identity to split into two angles.   If it's a special angle, evaluate it directly.  If it's a variable angle, sketch it, create a triangle with , and , and solve for the unknown side. Don't forget a negative sign if or is negative!

  "body": " Solving Equations Graphically   Graphing calculators, like Desmos , or the TI-84 Plus CE, can solve equations graphically very easily. The basic idea is to graph both sides of the equation, and the solutions are the intersection points.    Solving Equations Using a Graphing Calculator (Intersections)   Solving by Intersection  Solve the equation . To do this, graph both sides of the equation, and ( Desmos graph ). Observe the intersection points are at and . You can check that these are solutions, by plugging in and and verifying that both sides are equal,   Intuitively, this is because the equation is asking,  For which values of do the two expressions give the same number?  Then, a point is an intersection if it lies on both graphs, meaning that for that particular -value, the value for the left side is the same as the -value for the right side. That's what it means for the two sides of the equation to be equal.   In general, we want to solve an equation of the form,   where are expressions involving (that represent the two sides of the equation).   Graph both and .  The solutions are the -values of any intersection points of the two graphs.   In short,     Solving Numerically by Finding Zeros (Reducing to One Graph)  In fact, there is a slightly easier way. The general problem of solving an equation of the form,   can be rewritten by moving everything to one side (say, subtracting from both sides), to get . Then, the equation is in the form of one function equal to 0,   where . This transforms the problem from solving an equation with two separate sides, to finding the root of a (single) function. Then, to solve,   Graph .  The solutions are the -intercepts (zeros) of the graph.   In other words,     Comparing the Two Methods  Both the intersection method and the zeros method are mathematically equivalent, in that both will give you the same answer. However, there are some advantages and disadvantages to each, both practically and conceptually.    The intersection method is more intuitive, because you can visually see where the two functions intersect. If the functions represent some quantity, then it also has a useful interpretation.   Interpretating Intersection  For example, if represents how far each object has gone in seconds, then the intersection point means that after seconds, both objects have travelled the same distance . In contrast, with the zeros method, the -coordinate is always 0 and has no interpretation.     The zeros method is more computationally simpler, because you only have one function. Graphically, you only have to look near the -axis to find solutions. This is especially helpful when the functions are huge, and so you'd have to zoom out a lot to see the intersections.   Solving with the Zeros Method  Solve the equation . Using the intersection method , there is 1 intersection visible, but there is another intersection that is only visible if you zoom out a lot. Instead, using the zeros method, move all terms to one side, to get . Then, graphing this function , you can more easily see the 2 zeros of the graph, which are the solutions.       Solving Equations Graphically on the TI-84 Plus CE  With the TI-84 Plus CE, the strategy is similar to using Desmos, except it requires a few more button presses. Again, you can either do the intersection method ( ) or the zeros method ( ).   Enter the functions : Press [Y=] to to to the function editor. Enter the left side of the equation in Y1 and the right side in Y2. For example, for the equation , put in Y1 and in Y2. If solving , enter the expression in Y1 (and leave Y2 blank).  Adjust the window (if needed): Press [WINDOW] to set appropriate viewing bounds for Xmin, Xmax, Ymin, and Ymax so the graph and intersection points are visible. You can use [ZOOM] 6 (ZStandard) for a default view.  Graph the functions : Press [GRAPH] to display the graphs.   Find the intersection or root : Press [2nd] [TRACE] (CALC menu), then select 5: intersect (for intersection of two functions) or 2: zero (for roots of a single function). It will ask you to set a lower bound (Left Bound?) and upper bound (Right Bound?). These bounds define the interval for where the calculator will search for the solution, so make sure it's between them. Move the cursor with the arrow keys, and press [ENTER] for each.  It will also ask for a Guess?, which doesn't really matter, you can just press [ENTER] again (technically, the guess helps refine the search, but it only really helps for complicated functions that have many roots which are close together).

  "body": " Solving Equations Numerically with a Calculator   A large amount of high school mathematics is about solving equations. You learn various techniques to solve equations by hand (also called solving algebraically ), which work for various types of equations. However, for many types of equations, there is no algebraic technique that can solve them.   For example, in fact, these equations can't be solved algebraically:      No matter how hard you try to manipulate the equation, factor, and isolate for , you won't be able to solve for exactly.  If you have learned about exponential functions, logarithmic functions, and\/or trigonometric functions, here are some more examples:          These equations are simple to write down, but none of them can be solved algebraically. More generally, most equations with a combination of exponentials, polynomials, and trigonometric functions are unsolvable algebraically.   In this case, the next best thing is to find an approximate numerical solution.  These make up the two broad approaches to solving equations:     Algebraic \/ analytic \/ exact methods : Manipulating the equation using algebraic rules, to isolate the variable, and find an exact solution.     Approximate \/ numerical methods : Finding a solution which is an approximate decimal number, that is close enough.    Numerical solutions are useful in a few situations:   If an exact solution can't be found (it's just impossible).  If an exact solution is possible but just really difficult to find (especially in applications, an approximate numerical answer is usually good enough)  If you've already solved algebraically, and you want to check that your final answer is correct.     Solving Using a Scientific Calculator  My recommended calculator Casio fx-991ES Plus C 2nd edition (or some other similar scientific calculators) can solve equations numerically. This is truly powerful, because you can check your solutions to any equation.    First, make sure you're in COMP (computation) mode (which is the regular mode), by pressing MODE , then select COMP .    Enter your equation. Use the ALPHA button to get X (look for the button that has X above it). For the sign, use ALPHA then CALC .    Start the SOLVE function, by pressing SHIFT , then CALC .    Provide an initial guess for , such as , then press .    View the solution. The calculator shows the value of . It also displays (left side minus right side), which will be 0 (or at least very close to ) if the solution is accurate.     Solving a Radical Equation  For example, to solve ,    Enter .    Select SOLVE , by pressing SHIFT , then CALC .    Enter an initial guess, like , and press .    The solution should be .     If the solution is not a nice number (like a whole number), the solution will be a decimal like , not symbolic like .    If is anything but 0 (or very close to it), then the calculator couldn't find the solution. Try a different guess.    The initial guess kinda matters, but most reasonable guesses should give you the correct answer. Here are some broad principles:    Ideally, try to give a good guess as you can. For example, a number close to the solution you got from solving by hand.    If there are multiple solutions, the calculator will only give you one of them (each time). This is because the calculator basically pulls your initial guess towards the closest solution. E.g. if the solutions are and , and your initial guess is , you will most likely get . Whereas if you choose initial guess of , you will get .    If you have no idea what the solution should be, try 0 or 1 as a default. Because many equations have solutions near 0.    This feature is truly powerful, because you can check your solutions to any equation.    If the calculator agrees with your algebraic steps, then you know your answer is correct.    If it gives a different solution than what you found, then you know you have a mistake somewhere, and can go back and try to find it. E.g. maybe you dropped a negative sign, or didn't collect like terms properly.    You can also use it to solve an equation if you are stuck, however most tests will require you to show your work as well.   "
